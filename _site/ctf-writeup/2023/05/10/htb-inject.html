  <h1>Hack The Box - Inject [Easy]</h1>

  <p>The machine is labeled misleadingly <em>easy</em>, but that can lead you to miss stuff, so make sure to check <strong>everything</strong>!</p>

<p>A simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nmap</code> scan shows us that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8080</code> port is open.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Nmap scan report <span class="k">for </span>10.10.11.204

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s start by simply inspecting the website that is running on port <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:8080</code>.</p>

<p>The website seems like it has an upload form that we can upload images, my initial thought was LFI vulnerability, so I’ve checked it and I found it.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>http://10.10.11.204:8080/show_image?img=&lt;vulnerable  to LFI&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now I’ve wandered around exploring the website’s source code and after a bit of digging and searching I was on the verge of giving up. Since the machine is labeled easy, I didn’t exactly expect that the way to find a vulnerability is through https://spring.io/security/cve-2022-22963 (CVE-2022-22963) and I overlooked the versions that were listed in the maven build file (which you could exfiltrate from the LFI vulnerability).</p>

<p>After that, a reverse shell using this https://github.com/lemmyz4n3771/CVE-2022-22963-PoC POC was easy-peasy.</p>

<p>While enumerating the users, we can see that we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root, phil ,frank</code> and a group that is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staff</code>. So changing from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frank</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phil</code> was through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/frank/.m2/settings.xml</code> which had the credentials to change the user to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phil</code>.</p>

<p>You can get your first flag after that.</p>

<p>Changing to root was a bit tricky at first since I was trying to create a new playbook, which caused some errors and I finally decided to use the currently created one with the following payload.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">'[{hosts: localhost, tasks: [shell: /bin/sh &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;/dev/tty]}]'</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> ./playbook_1.yml
&lt;blabla&gt;
<span class="nv">$ </span>bash <span class="nt">-p</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">whoami
</span>root
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And there we have it!</p>
