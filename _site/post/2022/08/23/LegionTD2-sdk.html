  <h1>LegionTD2 Go SDK (v0.2.0)</h1>

  <p><img src="/legiontdsdk/header.png" alt="LegionTD2" /></p>

<p>Recently I’ve been fascinated with a game called <a href="https://beta.legiontd2.com/">LegionTD2</a>, this is a newly created game that I’ve been playing
as a map ever since Warcraft 3, it is tactical multiplayer tower-defense(td). The game is based on predictions and timings, if you play your cards right (or in the context of the game: sends/workers/units) you will prevail over the enemy team. Read more about it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/469600/Legion_TD_2__Multiplayer_Tower_Defense/">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="legiontd-sdk">LegionTD SDK</h1>

<p>I’ve doing stuff in Go in my free time (mainly code challenges) for a while now and I’ve decided that I should spend some time creating something useful for myself such as creating tools that would help me get better at the game. The game has an API which resides <a href="https://swagger.legiontd2.com/">here</a>, there are couple of endpoints that are useful for helpful statistics such as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">player/*</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">games/*</code> endpoints. I knew that I will be querying the API a lot for 
fetching info about players and games, so I’ve decided to create an SDK for that so I can ease my work a little bit. And after couple of weeks free time work I’ve created the <a href="https://github.com/syrull/ltdsdk">LegionTD 2 SDK for Go</a>.</p>

<h1 id="functionality">Functionality</h1>

<h2 id="analyze-games">Analyze games</h2>

<p>While my ultimate goal is to create set of analytics tools for Legion, I’ve created the most basic example of how that might happen using SQLite3 and Go.</p>

<p>Under the <a href="https://github.com/syrull/ltdsdk/tree/main/examples/analyze_games">examples/analyze_games/</a> I’ve created an example that fetches about 3k games and put them into a SQLite database, after that you are able to analyze the data using SQL. I’ve created a simple query that gets the percentage of games 
that are being finished at waves 15, 13 and 10.</p>

<p>In my case here are the results, games finished at wave</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Wave 15</th>
      <th>Wave 13</th>
      <th>Wave 10</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>20%</td>
      <td>14%</td>
      <td>4%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="exporting-the-games">Exporting the games</h2>

<p>You can derive that from the previous example but I’ve created a dedicated examples for both exporting to JSON and exporting to SQL.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/syrull/ltdsdk/tree/main/examples/export_games_to_sql">Export games to SQL</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/syrull/ltdsdk/blob/main/examples/export_games_to_json/main.go">Export games to JSON</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fetching-all-of-the-units">Fetching all of the Units</h2>

<p>Since that the game hasn’t got a dedicated route for fetching all the units I’ve created a simple example that resides in the repository under <a href="https://github.com/syrull/ltdsdk/tree/main/examples/get_all_units">examples/get_all_units</a>. The important thing here is that I’ve exported all the units into a single txt file and then I just spawn requests for each unit.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>I will be updating the SDK as I am progressing with the analytical tools and I will be adding new examples and adding new posts as I am doing it. For now you can keep an eye on the <a href="https://github.com/syrull/ltdsdk/">repository</a> and I will be definitely posting/discussing more about it in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ttnSSqyV">Discord Channel</a>.</p>
