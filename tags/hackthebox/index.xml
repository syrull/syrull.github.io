On the bottom of the page, we can see the versions of the used software:
Powered by Flask and Searchor 2.4.0 $ whatweb Bootstrap[4.1.3], Country[RESERVED][ZZ], HTML5, HTTPServer[Werkzeug/2.1.2 Python/3.10.6], IP[10.10.11.208], JQuery[3.2.1], Python[3.10.6], Script, Title[Searcher], Werkzeug[2.1.2] A simple google search would yield a bug that has been removed in Searchor 2.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Escape [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-escape/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jun 2023 02:01:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-escape/</guid><description>This is a Windows Machine which is part of an Active Directory. I would try my best to explain the stuff that I did, since that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen pretty bad write-ups that are not explaining anything. I also want to be honest, and I will link every write-up that I used to exploit the machine.
I am still learning Active Directory at the time of writing this, so there might be errors, I will do my best to mitigate that!</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Precious [Easy]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-precious/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-precious/</guid><description>We begin with a simple web page that has an input, apparently this input turns a webpage to a PDF, I tried with hosting a page on my machine and tried to use it for the input.
Then the website provided me with a PDF of the website that I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted, I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the PDF and used the exiftool to figure out what was generating this PDF file, from there I saw that it was generated by pdfkit v0.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - MetaTwo [Easy]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-metatwo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-metatwo/</guid><description>Starting out with rustscan

You will find the following vulnerabilities: - Local File Inclusion - Command Injection or RCE
Flag 1 I started by looking through the website to get some idea of its functionality. I saw that this is some sort of converter of data, like binary to hex and so on.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Vessel [Hard]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-vessel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 10:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-vessel/</guid><description>Overview Since it becomes very time consuming doing this in a video this write-up is going to be in a text.
The machine is labeled hard with a good reason, most of the tasks are time consuming but there are some interesting vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0811 and CVE-2022-24637.
On top of these we have NoSQL Injection and some PE reverse engineering.
Write-up Flag 1 First I began enumerating the whole website with ffuf.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Investigation [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-investigation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-investigation/</guid><description>This box consist of several vulnerabilities:
Command Injection - Used a vulnerability in exiftool that allowed me to run arbitrary code. Leaked Credentials - Then we found the .msg file which contained an event logs from a Windows machine where we found the credentials for user smorton. I wasted a lot of time an effort to figure that one out, so don&amp;rsquo;t be discouraged when you can&amp;rsquo;t find it in the first 5 mins.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Broscience [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-broscience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-broscience/</guid><description>Short Overview The video consist of my process of enumeration and overall hacking the machine, please use this as a walkthrough.
This box consist of several vulnerabilities:
Local File Inclusion/Path traversal - The query string path= in the img.php file is vulnerable to that, with that we can download the site map that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered using Burp Deserialization / PHP Object Injection - I saw that in the utils.php file, and I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a payload for the AvatarInterface since this is the class that is using magic methods, and it has the file_get_contents function that we are going to use to pull the PHP reverse shell.</description></item></channel></rss>
