Quick notes about how to forward an ssh agent and other tricks regarding the installation of python packages. 

## Using SSH Forwarding 

Exporting the `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable in the image. 

```
$ docker run -rm -t -i -v $(dirname $SSH_AUTH_SOCK) -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Or in the `environment` section of a compose file.

```
environment:
  SSH_AUTH_SOCK: $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

### Eventual Issues with that

- Installing ssh in the container
- Adding entries to `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts`


### Caveats

- Traces of ssh keys inside the image
