I decided to take a deep look at how FLOSS is working and possibly recreate some of its functionality in my own tool.
Before reading further, I want you to know that this post is about research I did on static analysis.</description></item><item><title>Using DNS as C2 Communication - Evasive Techniques (Part 3)</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/dns-c2-communcation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 20:45:03 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/dns-c2-communcation/</guid><description>Series Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 1) Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 2) (this one) Overview Following my last post about some evasion techniques that the Symbiote uses which I tried to recreate in their simplest form, this post will see how the Symbiote is communicating to the command and control C2 server.
Upon reading the article, we can see that the Symbiote uses the DNS Protocol to exfiltrate data out of the infected machine, the way that it does that is by chunking it into a bunch of A Resource Records (RR) that it sends through the UDP.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 2)</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/dynamic-linker-hijacking-experiments-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 21:45:03 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/dynamic-linker-hijacking-experiments-2/</guid><description>Series Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 1) (this one) Using DNS as C2 Communication - Evasive Techniques (Part 3) Journey Post This post is a something that I call &amp;ldquo;journey post&amp;rdquo;, this follows my process of researching and implementing the solution for the problem (or the challenge).

I was very intrigued by how that malware is being implemented and how it works internally to remain undetected, so naturally I&amp;rsquo;ve started to research it.
I highly advise you to read through these articles first before we begin with the actual post:</description></item><item><title>LegionTD2 Go SDK (v0.2.0)</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/legiontd2-sdk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Aug 2022 21:44:47 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/legiontd2-sdk/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated with a game called LegionTD2, this is a newly created game that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing as a map ever since Warcraft 3, it is tactical multiplayer tower-defense(td). The game is based on predictions and timings, if you play your cards right (or in the context of the game: sends/workers/units) you will prevail over the enemy team. Read more about it here.
LegionTD SDK I&amp;rsquo;ve doing stuff in Go in my free time (mainly code challenges) for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I should spend some time creating something useful for myself such as creating tools that would help me get better at the game.</description></item><item><title>Create Plugin Architecture With Python</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/create-plugin-architecture-with-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 21:44:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/create-plugin-architecture-with-python/</guid><description>There are some use-cases where a plugin architecture is needed, I call this &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; plugins but it is quite possible that there is already a word for that. The idea is to &amp;rsquo;load&amp;rsquo; functions or classes that are dynamically created so that you can have the reference to the instances at runtime. I&amp;rsquo;ve created 2 solutions for that matter one that is using the __subclasses__ dunder method and one using a decorator.</description></item><item><title>Simple Fishing Bot for World of Warcraft</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/simple-fishing-bot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 21:37:03 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/simple-fishing-bot/</guid><description>This fishing bot consists only of about 50 lines of code, it incorporates the mechanics of World of Warcraft and some simple Windows API Calls.
Repository: https://github.com/syrull/simple-fishing-bot
Overview The bot has about ~99% success rate, there are some extremely rare cases where the bot won&amp;rsquo;t catch it and I will explain why later. The method that the bot is using, should work in almost any fishing scenario in the game, I would personally avoid crowded places.</description></item><item><title>STIX/TAXII - Complete Knowledge</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/stix-taxii-complete-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 21:42:39 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/stix-taxii-complete-knowledge/</guid><description>Introduction STIX What is STIX and what is TAXII? In the most simple terms STIX is a model of Threat Intelligence that is represented in motivations, abilities, capabilities and response objects. Those objects are then represented in either JSON (STIX 2) or XML (STIX 1).
Here is a very simple representation of STIX Objects in a graph. Explanation of the example
The data can be helpful for preventing or mitigating various kinds of attacks that can be expressed with STIX.</description></item><item><title>Installing Private Packages in Docker Image - Notes</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/installing-private-packages-in-docker-image-notes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 21:44:47 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/installing-private-packages-in-docker-image-notes/</guid><description>Quick notes about how to forward an ssh agent and other tricks regarding the installation of python packages.
