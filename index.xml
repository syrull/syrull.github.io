I would try my best to explain the stuff that I did, since that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen pretty bad write-ups that are not explaining anything. I also want to be honest, and I will link every write-up that I used to exploit the machine.
I am still learning Active Directory at the time of writing this, so there might be errors, I will do my best to mitigate that!</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Precious [Easy]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-precious/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-precious/</guid><description>We begin with a simple web page that has an input, apparently this input turns a webpage to a PDF, I tried with hosting a page on my machine and tried to use it for the input.
Then the website provided me with a PDF of the website that I&amp;rsquo;ve hosted, I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded the PDF and used the exiftool to figure out what was generating this PDF file, from there I saw that it was generated by pdfkit v0.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Encoding [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-encoding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 02:01:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-encoding/</guid><description>This machine took me a couple of days due to its complexity and some minor stuff that were a hassle to get right.
You will find the following vulnerabilities: - Local File Inclusion - Command Injection or RCE
Flag 1 I started by looking through the website to get some idea of its functionality. I saw that this is some sort of converter of data, like binary to hex and so on.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Interface [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-interface/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 02:01:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-interface/</guid><description>The most important in this machine would be the enumeration, it exploits vulnerabilities like:
CVE-2022-28368 Executing files with sudo privileges Recon I started with just the website interface.htb where there isn&amp;rsquo;t much going on, from what I gathered I saw that it was a Next.js application, but the interesting thing there were the headers.

The machine is labeled hard with a good reason, most of the tasks are time consuming but there are some interesting vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0811 and CVE-2022-24637.
On top of these we have NoSQL Injection and some PE reverse engineering.
Write-up Flag 1 First I began enumerating the whole website with ffuf.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Investigation [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-investigation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-investigation/</guid><description>This box consist of several vulnerabilities:
Command Injection - Used a vulnerability in exiftool that allowed me to run arbitrary code. Leaked Credentials - Then we found the .msg file which contained an event logs from a Windows machine where we found the credentials for user smorton. I wasted a lot of time an effort to figure that one out, so don&amp;rsquo;t be discouraged when you can&amp;rsquo;t find it in the first 5 mins.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Stocker [Easy]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-stocker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-stocker/</guid><description>Short Overview This box consist of several vulnerabilities:
NoSQL Injection - Specifically the part with sending the payload using JSON, we use this vulnerability to bypass the login process. Server Side Template Injection - We could directly use HTML and then inject an iframe which src is set to /etc/passwd and after that we traverse the application itself to find the MongoDB user/password, and we used those to connect successfully to the machine using the password provided there.</description></item><item><title>Malware Analysis - CB Challenges</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/malware-analysis-2022cb-challenges/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/malware-analysis-2022cb-challenges/</guid><description>Overview Putting up my analysis of some malware samples.

I decided to take a deep look at how FLOSS is working and possibly recreate some of its functionality in my own tool.
Before reading further, I want you to know that this post is about research I did on static analysis.</description></item><item><title>Using DNS as C2 Communication - Evasive Techniques (Part 3)</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/dns-c2-communcation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 20:45:03 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/dns-c2-communcation/</guid><description>Series Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 1) Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 2) (this one) Overview Following my last post about some evasion techniques that the Symbiote uses which I tried to recreate in their simplest form, this post will see how the Symbiote is communicating to the command and control C2 server.
Upon reading the article, we can see that the Symbiote uses the DNS Protocol to exfiltrate data out of the infected machine, the way that it does that is by chunking it into a bunch of A Resource Records (RR) that it sends through the UDP.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 2)</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/dynamic-linker-hijacking-experiments-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 21:45:03 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/dynamic-linker-hijacking-experiments-2/</guid><description>Series Dynamic Linker Hijacking Experiments - Evasive Techniques (Part 1) (this one) Using DNS as C2 Communication - Evasive Techniques (Part 3) Journey Post This post is a something that I call &amp;ldquo;journey post&amp;rdquo;, this follows my process of researching and implementing the solution for the problem (or the challenge).

I was very intrigued by how that malware is being implemented and how it works internally to remain undetected, so naturally I&amp;rsquo;ve started to research it.

The game is based on predictions and timings, if you play your cards right (or in the context of the game: sends/workers/units) you will prevail over the enemy team. Read more about it here.
LegionTD SDK I&amp;rsquo;ve doing stuff in Go in my free time (mainly code challenges) for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I should spend some time creating something useful for myself such as creating tools that would help me get better at the game.</description></item><item><title>Create Plugin Architecture With Python</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/create-plugin-architecture-with-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2022 21:44:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/create-plugin-architecture-with-python/</guid><description>There are some use-cases where a plugin architecture is needed, I call this &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; plugins but it is quite possible that there is already a word for that. The idea is to &amp;rsquo;load&amp;rsquo; functions or classes that are dynamically created so that you can have the reference to the instances at runtime. I&amp;rsquo;ve created 2 solutions for that matter one that is using the __subclasses__ dunder method and one using a decorator.</description></item><item><title>Simple Fishing Bot for World of Warcraft</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/simple-fishing-bot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 21:37:03 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/simple-fishing-bot/</guid><description>This fishing bot consists only of about 50 lines of code, it incorporates the mechanics of World of Warcraft and some simple Windows API Calls.
Repository: https://github.com/syrull/simple-fishing-bot
Overview The bot has about ~99% success rate, there are some extremely rare cases where the bot won&amp;rsquo;t catch it and I will explain why later. The method that the bot is using, should work in almost any fishing scenario in the game, I would personally avoid crowded places.</description></item><item><title>STIX/TAXII - Complete Knowledge</title><link>https://sy1.sh/posts/stix-taxii-complete-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 21:42:39 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/posts/stix-taxii-complete-knowledge/</guid><description>Introduction STIX What is STIX and what is TAXII? In the most simple terms STIX is a model of Threat Intelligence that is represented in motivations, abilities, capabilities and response objects. Those objects are then represented in either JSON (STIX 2) or XML (STIX 1).
Here is a very simple representation of STIX Objects in a graph. Explanation of the example
