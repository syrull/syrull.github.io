      <description>Overview I&amp;rsquo;ve initially thought that this is a JavaScript command injection challenge, since that we have the flag located at the root and we have a binary that is being executed (/usr/games/cowsay). I began to read the documentation of google/zx , but after a while I didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that could lead to command injection.
Then I&amp;rsquo;ve started to explore the binary itself /usr/games/cowsay, I also setup a verbose output for ZX as I&amp;rsquo;ve read the documentation.</description>
