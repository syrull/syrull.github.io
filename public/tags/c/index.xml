      <description>Overview Recently, I decided do delve a little bit more into static analysis, something beyond just running strings on a binary and getting the ASCII characters that are printable. I decided to take a deep look at how FLOSS is working and possibly recreate some of its functionality in my own tool.&#xA;Before reading further, I want you to know that this post is about research I did on static analysis.</description>

      <description>Journey Post This post is a something that I call &amp;ldquo;journey post&amp;rdquo;, this follows my process of researching and implementing the solution for the problem (or the challenge). I will wrap/pre-fix parts of the post with html-like &amp;lt;journey&amp;gt; so that you can skip it if you are in a hurry.&#xA;Overview In the last post I&amp;rsquo;ve described how I hid a file from all the sys calls that are using readdir.</description>

      <description>Overview Recently I heard about a new malware called Symbiote , which the researches are calling the &amp;ldquo;Nearly-Impossible-to-Detect Linux Threat&amp;rdquo;. I was very intrigued by how that malware is being implemented and how it works internally to remain undetected, so naturally I&amp;rsquo;ve started to research it.&#xA;I highly advise you to read through these articles first before we begin with the actual post:&#xA;Hijack Execution Flow: Dynamic Linker Hijacking What Is the LD_PRELOAD?</description>
