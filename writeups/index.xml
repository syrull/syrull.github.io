I would try my best to explain the stuff that I did, since that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen pretty bad write-ups that are not explaining anything. I also want to be honest, and I will link every write-up that I used to exploit the machine.
I am still learning Active Directory at the time of writing this, so there might be errors, I will do my best to mitigate that!</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Interface [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-interface/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 02:01:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-interface/</guid><description>The most important in this machine would be the enumeration, it exploits vulnerabilities like:
CVE-2022-28368 Executing files with sudo privileges Recon I started with just the website interface.htb where there isn&amp;rsquo;t much going on, from what I gathered I saw that it was a Next.js application, but the interesting thing there were the headers.

You will find the following vulnerabilities: - Local File Inclusion - Command Injection or RCE
Flag 1 I started by looking through the website to get some idea of its functionality. I saw that this is some sort of converter of data, like binary to hex and so on.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Vessel [Hard]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-vessel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2023 10:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-vessel/</guid><description>Overview Since it becomes very time consuming doing this in a video this write-up is going to be in a text.
The machine is labeled hard with a good reason, most of the tasks are time consuming but there are some interesting vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-0811 and CVE-2022-24637.
On top of these we have NoSQL Injection and some PE reverse engineering.
Write-up Flag 1 First I began enumerating the whole website with ffuf.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Investigation [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-investigation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-investigation/</guid><description>This box consist of several vulnerabilities:
Command Injection - Used a vulnerability in exiftool that allowed me to run arbitrary code. Leaked Credentials - Then we found the .msg file which contained an event logs from a Windows machine where we found the credentials for user smorton. I wasted a lot of time an effort to figure that one out, so don&amp;rsquo;t be discouraged when you can&amp;rsquo;t find it in the first 5 mins.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Broscience [Medium]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-broscience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-broscience/</guid><description>Short Overview The video consist of my process of enumeration and overall hacking the machine, please use this as a walkthrough.
This box consist of several vulnerabilities:
Local File Inclusion/Path traversal - The query string path= in the img.php file is vulnerable to that, with that we can download the site map that I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered using Burp Deserialization / PHP Object Injection - I saw that in the utils.php file, and I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a payload for the AvatarInterface since this is the class that is using magic methods, and it has the file_get_contents function that we are going to use to pull the PHP reverse shell.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Stocker [Easy]</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-stocker/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/htb-stocker/</guid><description>Hack The Box - Stocker [Easy]</description></item><item><title>Malware Analysis - CB Challenges</title><link>https://sy1.sh/writeups/malware-analysis-2022cb-challenges/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 19:42:27 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://sy1.sh/writeups/malware-analysis-2022cb-challenges/</guid><description>Overview Putting up my analysis of some malware samples.
