I began with a simple scan, to check the ports of the machine.

```bash
$ rustscan -a 
Open 10.10.11.218:22
Open 10.10.11.218:80
Open 10.10.11.218:443
```

I went to the website that is being hosted on port 80, and I saw that there is some sort of PGP stuff. Furthermore, I noticed the following URLs:

```http
https://ssa.htb/login
https://ssa.htb/
https://ssa.htb/pgp # the site's public key
https://ssa.htb/guide # some sort of playground for PGP
https://ssa.htb/contact
https://ssa.htb/guide/verify
https://ssa.htb/about
https://ssa.htb/login?next=%2Fadmin
https://ssa.htb/guide/encrypt
```

In the `/guide` endpoint there is some sort of playground for PGP, and while I was playing with it, I have noticed that when I am using the verify signature there is output that looked like pulled from the console. 

I've enumerated the technologies and versions that the website is using, I found that it used Flask as the main server application and (possibly Flask for the frontend/templating engine). 

## RCE 

When I saw Flask I thought that the application could be using Jinja, so I immediately thought that this could be a potential [SSTI](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssti-server-side-template-injection). 
I had only a single entry point that could give me output which was through `Verify Signature` in the `/guide` endpoint. 

### Crafting the exploit

The injection point is the `name` of the PGP key, so I've generated a key called `syl`.

```bash
$ gpg --gen-key
```

The exploit is described/explained [here](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection#jinja2).

After that, we need to export the public key using this command:

```bash
$ gpg -a -o public_key.key --export syl
```

then we should craft an arbitrary message:

```bash
$ echo 'test' | gpg --clear-sign
```

--- 
### Common Issues

While crafting this, I've experienced serious hassles such as:
- wrongfully crafting the message
- using different key to encrypt the message

I fixed those issues when I started clean and using only 1 key, and whenever asked for anything "passphrase/name" I just typed "syl".

To check the current keys that you have:

```
$ gpg --list-keys
```

Another useful website is this one: https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/modify-gpg-uid-name/ I've used the article to modify the name of the key, and then to export the public key again.

Upon crafting the message, paste the message and the public key and click to verify the signature, this would get you a reverse shell to the machine.

## Atlas (`firejailed`)

The user that we got `atlas` is actually is `firejailed`, commands such as `wget/curl` are not available in the environment. The pivot point is in the `httpie` directory in the `$HOME` folder. There you can find the `admin.json` file where the SSH credentials for the user `silentobserver` are. 

## `silentobserver`

I ran `linpeas.sh` to check where would my next pivoting point would be, I stumbled fairly fast on these files that I could write:

```
/opt/crates/logger/src
/opt/crates/logger/src/lib.rs
```

I noticed the application located in the `/opt` directory `/opt/tipnet/` I've examined the source code, and it is some sort of `rust` application, I already got a hint to those writable directories and whenever I saw the source code:

```rust
extern crate logger;
...
logger::log(username, keywords.as_str().trim(), justification.as_str()); // Invoking it later on.
```

I knew that I could modify the crate that could be executed by the application.

But what is this application? And where is it running?

## `Tipnet` Application

This application is running like that: 

```
/bin/sh -c cd /opt/tipnet && bin/echo "e" | /bin/sudo -u atlas /usr/bin/cargo run --offline sleep 10
```

We can see the user `atlas(not firejailed)` is running it, so this could be our next attack vector.

I've crafted a rust reverse shell: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html and added it into the `logger/src/lib.rs` file then I build the crate using `cargo build`.

After some seconds, your listener should be getting a connection from the server, that would be the `atlas` user.

# `Atlas` user to `root`

Fairly simple and straightforward, this is a [CVE-2022-31214](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-m2xv-wgqg-4gxh "CVE-2022-31214") vulnerability. You can use the already crafted exploits for that:

- https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/08/10 

There are issues with that exploit, I believe it is in the `wait` mechanism. To make sure that it is working correctly add a `breakpoint()` in the beginning of the script then you can follow the execution by pressing "n".
