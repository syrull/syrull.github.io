This box consist of several vulnerabilities:

* [Command Injection](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/command-injection) - Used a vulnerability in `exiftool` that allowed me to run arbitrary code.
* Leaked Credentials - Then we found the `.msg` file which contained an event logs from a Windows machine where we found the credentials for user `smorton`. I wasted a lot of time an effort to figure that one out, so don't be discouraged when you can't find it in the first 5 mins. 
* Sudo commands - We then found the mysterious `/usr/bin/binary` file that we could use sudo with and that led us to analyze it further where we found that it accepts 2 arguments, and it downloads a file, saves it with a specific name and runs it using `perl`.
