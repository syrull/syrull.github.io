I've started my OSCP journey a while ago, and I wanted to try the PG machines, this is the first one that I've tried. The machine is fairly straightforward and it's labeled easy.

I've started with a simple `nmap` scan, which hinted that this Linux machine is part of an Active Directory.

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

On the port `80` we have a simple web page which is more or less just a placeholder of a template, but on the `8000` we have a functional website build with `Koken`

```

I immediately searched for exploits for `Koken 0.22.24`, and found this one: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48706

This is `authenticated` exploit, so it hinted that I must look further to get some credentials.

Upon scanning the Active Directory (`139,445`) I found public shares, one of which was non-default `sambashare`.

```bash
$ smbclient -N -L 192.168.160.76           
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
sambashare      Disk      Samba on Ubuntu
IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (photographer server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

I explored it and found 2 files, one was an email in a `txt` format and the other one was zipped WordPress site, I've scanned the WordPress source code with `gf` (https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) but found nothing. The mail thought had an interesting text inside that hinted two users and suggestion for a password.

```bash
agi@photographer.com - Agi Clarence
daisa@photographer.com - Daisa Ahomi
```

I found the password for the user `daisa@photographer.com` in the content of the mail. (It is very simple!)

After that, I logged into the `Koken's` Admin Panel and uploaded a simple PHP shell using the previously mentioned exploit. I could read the `user/local.txt` file that yielded the user own flag.

The root was pretty straightforward, upon scanning for `SUID` binaries, I found that `/usr/bin/php7.2` was such, and a simple request with the previous active shell yielded me the root flag.

```bash
GET /storage/originals/4f/38/image.php?cmd=/usr/bin/php7.2+-r+'readfile("/root/proof.txt")%3b' HTTP/1.1
