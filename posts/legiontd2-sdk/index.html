Read more about it here.\nLegionTD SDK I’ve doing stuff in Go in my free time (mainly code challenges) for a while now and I’ve decided that I should spend some time creating something useful for myself such as creating tools that would help me get better at the game. The game has an API which resides here, there are couple of endpoints that are useful for helpful statistics such as the player/* and games/* endpoints. I knew that I will be querying the API a lot for fetching info about players and games, so I’ve decided to create an SDK for that so I can ease my work a little bit. And after couple of weeks free time work I’ve created the LegionTD 2 SDK for Go.\nFunctionality Analyze games While my ultimate goal is to create set of analytics tools for Legion, I’ve created the most basic example of how that might happen using SQLite3 and Go.\nUnder the examples/analyze_games/ I’ve created an example that fetches about 3k games and put them into a SQLite database, after that you are able to analyze the data using SQL. I’ve created a simple query that gets the percentage of games that are being finished at waves 15, 13 and 10.\nIn my case here are the results, games finished at wave\nWave 15 Wave 13 Wave 10 20% 14% 4% Exporting the games You can derive that from the previous example but I’ve created a dedicated examples for both exporting to JSON and exporting to SQL.\nExport games to SQL Export games to JSON Fetching all of the Units Since that the game hasn’t got a dedicated route for fetching all the units I’ve created a simple example that resides in the repository under examples/get_all_units. The important thing here is that I’ve exported all the units into a single txt file and then I just spawn requests for each unit.\nConclusion I will be updating the SDK as I am progressing with the analytical tools and I will be adding new examples and adding new posts as I am doing it. For now you can keep an eye on the repository and I will be definitely posting/discussing more about it in the Discord Channel.\n","wordCount":"434","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-08-23T21:44:47+03:00","dateModified":"2022-08-23T21:44:47+03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dimitar Ganev"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://sy1.sh/posts/legiontd2-sdk/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"0x73796C31","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://sy1.sh/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://sy1.sh accesskey=h title="0x73796C31 (Alt + H)">0x73796C31</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://sy1.sh/posts/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://sy1.sh/cv title=CV><span>CV</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://sy1.sh>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://sy1.sh/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>LegionTD2 Go SDK (v0.2.0)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-08-23 21:44:47 +0300 +0300'>2022-08-23</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Dimitar Ganev&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/syrull/syrull.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/LegionTD2-sdk.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#legiontd-sdk aria-label="LegionTD SDK">LegionTD SDK</a></li><li><a href=#functionality aria-label=Functionality>Functionality</a><ul><li><a href=#analyze-games aria-label="Analyze games">Analyze games</a></li><li><a href=#exporting-the-games aria-label="Exporting the games">Exporting the games</a></li><li><a href=#fetching-all-of-the-units aria-label="Fetching all of the Units">Fetching all of the Units</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#conclusion aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p><img loading=lazy src=/legiontdsdk/header.png alt=LegionTD2></p><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been fascinated with a game called <a href=https://beta.legiontd2.com/>LegionTD2</a>, this is a newly created game that I&rsquo;ve been playing
